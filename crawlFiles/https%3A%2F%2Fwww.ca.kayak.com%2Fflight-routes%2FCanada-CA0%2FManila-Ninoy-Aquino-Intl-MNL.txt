They often do.Read more about Japan Airlines I hope they never ran out of the menu choice one makes. They often do. Pros: "The crew that checked me and those who were onboard were very helpful and cheerful." Cons: "Better choices of movies on board." Pros: "The crew always smiles and very accomodating." Cons: "The main course could have been better or improve. I wasn’t satisfied with the taste." Cons: "Trip to Manila from Tokyo was delayed for 3hrs plus" Pros: "All of the crews were polite and friendly, and the food was tasty." Cons: "If there're more variety of movies, that would be great." Cons: "I feel like this is Japan Airlines’s chance to present some great actual Japanese food in flight and instead it was a tuna melt and macaroni salad. Just saying." Pros: "was not able to board and was checked in 4 hours in advance" Cons: "Be able to select seats online within 24hours of flight for free" Pros: "The staff are really nice helpful and respectful." Cons: "I dont l8ke the restrooms, they shoukd be always be cleaned most of the times. No cup noodles." Cons: "The fact that my father was diagnosed with Cancer and they wouldn’t refund our 1300.00 for round trip tickets to the Philippines which is our vacation home. The airline required documentation from my fathers doc which I provided. He was not going anywhere for at least a year (radiation and chemo) and the denied even credit.I was able to get my parents tickets refunded by a different airline. NEVER Again. my father passed 8/12/2018. Our trip was scheduled for 9/13/2018. Very disappointing.see" I was handled by some very rude CSA's in DFW. I was forced to check my carry-on as I was flying economy. You are now allowed only 10 kg total on all carry-on items. As my carry-on was 10 kg, and my backpack was 2 kg, I was made to check my luggage. I find this procedure unfair, as many other passengers in economy CLEARLY had more than 10 kgs. If KA insists this is their policy, then it should be enforced uniformly for everyone. TO INCLUDE Business and First Class. They are allowed 18 kg now. From my perspective....absolutely ridiculous. This was the first time in over 35 years I have been made to check my carry-on. I am EXTREMELY disappointed 😞 Customer service is not a top priority from boarding to while on flight, was belittled on boarding Some staff speak english at almost a 0% fluency 2 hour connection time in Seoul to make plane to Bangkok. Giant security lineup. Lots of worry over making flight reduced joy of flying via KE/Incheon. This was a repeat of my flight in Nov 2022, so apparently is the new normal for KE. Flight was boarding after I was forced to jog what seemed to be 2 miles from security to my departure gate. Please fix this. I still cannot understand that if you have already been screened in Canada for dangerous items, and there is no opportunity to obtain any between one plane and the next, why you should be screened AGAIN. Pros: "There were movies." Cons: "too late giving out ear phones, and too many interruptions on the loud speaker....way too long explaining things everyone knows, like how to buckle your seat belt....give me a break." Pros: "Everything was great!" Cons: "Some announcements were only made in Korean. Would have been nice to have it in English for international flight." Pros: "Nice, clean efficient. Comfort was good." Cons: "The crew was great but pretty impersonal. Not a great selection of movies." Pros: "Crew was amazing and attentive as always." Cons: "An upgrade for more comfortable and ergonomic seats would make a lot of difference...." Pros: "Very friendly staff with excellent service. Bottled water in every seat upon boarding. Lots of leg room, and love the outer earphones they provide!" Cons: "More movie selections" Pros: "The crew was on it when it came to responding to the call button." Pros: "Very hard working, responsive and caring crew. Kept the washrooms clean throughout the flight. Pretty good space between rows considering economy class. Lots of little touches like slippers and toothbrush." Pros: "The 787 is fantastic. First class feels in the economy. The food offering is also first class. Service is amazing." Cons: "Serve the cold soba for all meals. :) Love it." Pros: "Crews were friendly and helpful. I never had economy seat that goes as flat as theirs. I liked the safety instruction video." Cons: "They seemed to run out of food options quickly. Wasn't a problem for me. But, they should know better." Pros: "Crew was amazing, food was filling & plentiful." Cons: "Overall no complaints but the landing in Tokyo was a little rough. Pilot seemed to descend quickly which hurt my ears but otherwise, smooth flight." Cons: "Food was great, flight attendant were very friendly and helpful and eager to make sure I was comfortable, ANA rocks as a awesome carrier; my goto airline when it’s time to cross the pacific again" Pros: "The crew was wonderful. Polite and professional. The meals were very good for economy class." Cons: "The seats felt like there was no padding in the seat. The back was fine." Pros: "The crew was amazing. They were all very nice to us." Pros: "Staff were friendly. Alcohol beverages are free. Good upsated movie selections." Pros: "The crew" Cons: "The seats were substantially more cramped than the other flight." Pros: "The crew was amazing! The food was really great! And the entertainment was fantastic! I would absolutely fly with them again the next time I book a trip." Pros: "Crews are very helpful and always have a smile in their face. Comfortable seats and entertainment system are very nice. The only thing that makes us not satisfied was the food, for 10 hours flight there’s only 1 main dish...Totally I like their service." Cons: "The food was not enough, we felt so hungry before arriving." Cons: "The food was terrible. Only one option and I didn't like it." Pros: "Was amazed because of the Hello Kitty theme in the plane , very friendly staff very worth trip" Cons: "Nothing everything went well" Cons: "can maybe be a little bit less strict on luggage weight" Pros: "nothing" Cons: "airport personells are rude and lazy. airline seats are very unconfortable. flight attendants not very a comodating to seniors like me" Cons: "Lock ( tsa approves) to )my luggage was damaged or deliberately cut off that it is difficulty to Manage the zipper with ease. Since the luggage’s were retrieved at end of the trip, I am not sure where these damaged occurred , either in states or Taipei or when tsa did their search, I do not have any noticed paper to explain the cause of damage lock either" Pros: "Despite the short flight, they still served a delicious meal! Great movie and music selections. Would definitely fly them again." Pros: "As I said on the last flight enjoyed the flight and the crew as amazing" Cons: "Just like on the last flight maybe have more inflight entertainment more movie and tv selection" Cons: "The only thing that was not the greatest, I think was the ground crew in Manila. It took an unusually long time to get my luggage." Cons: "I didn’t like the last meal that they served. It’s fish fillet with tomato sauce and no other option." Pros: "Was quite nice for a two hour flight. They gave us a free meal again." Cons: "Nothing I didn't like." Food was not great. Crew members were created hassle with attitude at the gates and wasted my valuable time. I have been traveling in Emirates airlines many times. Over all not happy flying in Emirates airlines this time. Seats are very small and not comfortable. Seats looks like very very old and congested. It would be nice if they fix these kind of issues. I hope my next trip will be hassle free and comfortable journey in Emirates airlines. Thank you. For such a long flight I feel the spacing of seats could’ve been better to make it more comfortable for passengers. Very little space to move & stretch legs. Pros: "The crew were very friendly and accommodating." Cons: "Most long flights giveaway a personal kit. They didn't." Pros: "The crew was cool." Cons: "More flexibility in terms of upgrading seats and changing flights while at the airport, especially if there is availability." Pros: "Lamb and chicken were good but kids didn't like the kids meals.." Cons: "2 of the female crew members had attitude problems when asked simple questions by passengers. One was an Urdu speaking flight attendant and the other was a blonde woman. Regret I didn't get their names. Please work with them on being nicer with passengers." Pros: "Punctuality" Cons: "The food, leg space, the drink, and more hospitality, specially towards the aged people like us." Pros: "I like overall, food , entertainment, cleanliness and the amazing crew." Cons: "I would fly again with emirates." Pros: "Everything was amazing, I would say best airlines from Male to Dubai. Crew is super amazing as well." Pros: "The crew was on point and did there jobs well." Cons: "The food was old fashioned and stuck in the 1960s. Having an option of Beef brisket or Salmon or two polarizing choices. I opted for the brisket and it was decent but not actually worth finishing. It was too fatty and strange tasting. Boarding in Sydney needs much improved screens and communication." Pros: "Crew was great." Cons: "On such a long flight from Dubai to Boston, the seats in coach were criminal! Way to narrow, not enough distance to seat in front of you, seats do NOT recline enough to be able to relax & get needed rest, no footrest & way overcrowded.
