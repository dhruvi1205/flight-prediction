Use your own device with no ear phones provided. Cons: "Everything was perfect, from taking off to landing, very smooth. Sweet cabin crew. Thank you for a safe flight" Pros: "The crew was awesome and they really made the flight so much better. I loved how short the flight was - just 58 minutes from Vancouver to Portland." Cons: "This is a turbo-prop commuter flight, so it's fairly noisy; also, there are no USB charge ports or entertainment system." Pros: "Aircraft was clean and comfortable. Crew was efficient and friendly. The whole experience was excellent!" Cons: "There was lots of entertainment available but plain old music was not an option. What if I don't want to watch a movie or TV, just listen to music!" Pros: "The flight delayed but the crew was really helping! Huge thank to the lady served in the economy class AS2239 on March 4th from Vancouver to Seattle. I was not able to catch the next flight without her helping." Pros: "none" Cons: "Cause the flight was canceled I have to call the airlines to get the refund, which not 100% refund, it makes me disappointed" Pros: "I liked that when due to a medical reason, I was able to be given the option of rebooking my flight even though there would be a penalty and extra charges and I would need to pay the difference." Cons: "When I called to rebook my flight within the year and about 3 months in advance of the desired date, unfortunately Latam made multiple errors and also told me that rebooking flights only are eligible for more expensive flights. Even though there were other less expensive flights that I was able to find and see online, they insisted the only flight available had a price difference of $4,000+ dollars. the original ticket was around $550 so this was absurd. Not helpful at all, how frustrating." Pros: "The crew were very polite and helpful." Cons: "The flight was delayed for an hour and no one could explain why." Pros: "Comfortable seats" Cons: "Delayed, may of been beyond the pilots control. Scrambled seating arrangements." Pros: "The crew was terrific" Cons: "The long delay was miserable. Although we would rather be on aircraft that was running like it should. We were dead at that point in our journey and the long delay was very difficult." I loved the crew's professionalism. The landing was unbelievably smooth, haven't experienced that in years Their system was slow so it took them well over 4 hours to complete checkin but they kept assuring us that the flight won’t leave without all the passengers as it’s their fault but at the end of 4th hour then tell us that the immigration will close for the night and the last few of us are left stranded behind. The customer service itnay open at night. The airlines does have its own crew at Toronto airport so no one to help us. Pros: "We got upgraded to business class due to getting bumped from flight." Cons: "We got bumped from our flight and split up so my wife and child had to go to Rosario on their own, and my other son and I had to take a separate flight via Buenos Aires, causing our prearranged driver to wait for many hours and significant delay and stress. Our short time in Rosario was cut shorter" Cons: "This doorbell sound was playing on repeat over the loudspeakers constantly for almost the entire second half of the flight. Drove me nuts" Pros: "I like the 2 2 seating" Cons: "Having to go to other counter to pay bag fees after check in is annoying. I get that with some fares you have to pay, but so much more efficient to swipe credit card at check in." Pros: "On time, clean, comfortable seats, free beverages, luggage arrived very quickly. An excellent flight." Pros: "The aircraft was very clean, well maintained. We were 20 min late in departing because the crew waited for a passenger with disabilities to make it to the plane. That was kind. Some of the lost time was made up and this flight had no connections out of the arrival airport that day, so not a major inconvenience. Short flight, so just drink service, no entertainment. Baggage arrived promptly. All good." Pros: "When my original flight schedule was interupted by one of the flights delay I was offered a very good alternative in a very kind manner." Cons: "The newly rescheduled flight had 2 and half hour delay" Pros: "The boarding process was fast. I appreciate being able to access SkyPriority boarding." Cons: "I wish my Delta SkyMiles status earned an upgrade to Business/First Class on this SkyMiles partner." Cons: "Statewide strike prevented me from taking the flight and could not obtain a refund." Cons: "Flew first class but still had to pay for internet. We also waited 20 minute in the runway after landing" Pros: "Fly attendants have no knowledge of hospitality. They arguing with customers and refusing to assist, blaming on company policies. My friends were assigned seats next to a toilet. No folding options. One of our friends has a back pain problems and got stuck for 5 hours. There were seats available upfront and Manager Gina could simply change our seats instead of dry “there is nothing I can do” I am not recommending this airline." Cons: "Food and service. Our flight attendant didn’t seem to want to be there. Sub-par service for first class by a long shot." Pros: "After a late, crowded boarding process, somehow the flight crew got us off the ground on time!" Cons: "Having more than 2 harried airline agents at the gate to handle the sold out flight filled with families with babies!" Cons: "When we booked this trip via Kayak, we thought that we were booking on Westjet. Westjet knew nothing about the flight when we tried to check in." Pros: "The ability to charge my cell phone via USB ports. Also the movies on long flights is really nice" Cons: "Quicker way to get off plane" Pros: "The flight attendants were amazing. 12 people had a connecting flight and they brought a shuttle bus. You dont see that kind of service any more 10 stars for that" Cons: "Super small plane." Pros: "The overall experience on the flight was quite pleasing. The flight crew created a warm atmosphere on what was a very cold morning. Seating was not the most comfortable but the wasn't unbearable." Cons: "Delta should have a better food menu for those early flights unless the motive is to encourage everyone to eat an organic and wholesome meal prior to boarding, something we all should be doing." Pros: "Crew was amazing." Cons: "Delayed departure due to late crew arrival. Not a huge deal." Pros: "Zee was our flight attendant and she was absolutely wonderful. Personable, attentive, and she made sure each and every person on the plane was comfortable and happy, going so far as to move solo passengers to empty rows so they could have more space. I wish she could be on every flight I take." The 787 was amazing. Listening to screaming and crying children for four hours was horrible. Small children should be in one section. Seats were very comfortable and leg room was fantastic. Information was very generic on timing. A lot of people needing bathroom before arrival some didn’t get to use; plane a little small felt cramped but worked still a bigger plane would be nice. Crew was friendly and flight was on time and smooth. No food for vegans 🤔 lucky i am considered slender. but i am 5'7", so in case of emergency it would have been completely impossible to put my head on my lap. THERE SIMPLY WAS NO ROOM TO BEND OVER, ALTHOUGH I AM MORE THAN CAPABLE(AS A LIFETIME OF YOGA WILL ATTEST TO). CRAZY DANGEROUS HOW SQUEEZED INTO THE SEATS WE WERE. i have travelled to mexico for almost 20 years, mostly on westjet, but they have obviously squeezed more seats into the 737 to ,,,,,you guessed it make more money!!!!!! also i had to repeatedly move my 'seatmate' as she kept falling asleep, and as she was definately not slender, she squished me into the window seat all through the flight., if i could have jumped out of the plane and swam to mexico i would have done it in a heartbeat. TERRIBLE FLIGHT, NO FOOD, OH, SORRY, FREE PRETZELS OR COOKIES. LOTS OF BOOZE FOR SALE THOUGH!!!! WORST FLIGHT OF MY LIFE!!!!! Pros: "NA" Cons: "We paid for transportation to cancun and it didn’t happen. We hope there will be compensation for the lost day. So disappointing." Cons: "No Food to buy available on board. We thought we could buy something. The coffee was good." Pros: "Excellent pre Boarding service and announcements; reasonably comfortable seats; great landing;" Cons: "There are never gluten free options in the snacks; there were no entertainment systems on the plane - that's not important to me but perhaps it is to others." Pros: "I felt really well treated. A guy even came for us to board because we were with a child" Cons: "I have no complains about it at all" Pros: "Seat was uncomfortable because of the head rest that is attached to the seat. However the staff and crew were friendly and helpful." Cons: "Better seats" Cons: "Our trip got completely rerouted - we are still in Edmonton and expected to be with family in Regina a couple of hours ago. :(((" Pros: "Newest 787 plane in the fleet.
