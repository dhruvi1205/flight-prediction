Pros: "As always Korean Air’s attention to detail is outstanding and impressive."

Great customer service!!!" Cons: "Seats of any airplane could use improvement on comfort. But comfort was good."

I reserved an aisle seat originally, aisle seats were available when I tried to change, but agent REFUSED to accommodate me with either aisle or window. Sat in middle with huge guy next to me. Very uncomfortable. Food was mediocre on this leg. Oh, and late departing AGAIN. Will seriously look for other options on next trip." Pros: "Plane was clean and modern. Staff was very courteous. An overall pleasant flight." Pros: "All around great airline. Comfortable for super long flights and completely accommodating." Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "Crew is meek and doesn’t smile or try very hard.

Cons: "During this trip all my flights got delayed and I was told that I could not get a hotel room and had to pay for myself." Pros: "The crew was very friendly. The plane was very quiet (except for noisy crying babies)." Cons: "Unless you can afford the higher priced "comfort class" or first class seats, the seating is very, very cramped on Delta's 757s. It's a good thing the flight was only 5+ hours (but that's not long enough to get any decent amount of sleep on this flight scheduled as a redeye)." Pros: "The only thing I liked about the experience and flight was the Delta Sky Club" Cons: "Everything" Pros: "Seat was hard, not much foot space" Cons: "My wife and Iasked for a snack, it was never delivered" Pros: "Seating was fine" Cons: "Did not have a wheelchair waiting for my wife when we arrived in LAX" Pros: "Crew was friendly" Cons: "An hour and a half late, terrible communication about scheduling" Pros: "nice crew" Cons: "terrible seat comfort, late departure due to airline’s booking problems" Pros: "Early warning about little overhead compartment baggage space.

Pros: "BC middles seats are good for couples and one of the better laid out BC’s. Service was good but maybe not as JAL, ANA, or SQ." Cons: "The console storage/center tables was splattered with coke or coffee and was not properly wiped down during cleaning." Pros: "Hardware was excellent. One of the most comfortable First Class seats for sure." Cons: "CX first class is designed more for individual travelers so for couples who want to sit beside one another there will be an aisle in between them. The Boston BA lounge is horrific and depressing so it should be avoided." Pros: "Good entertainment choices. Preferred check thru TSA. No one seating next to me." Cons: "I don't think I will use Kayak again. You farmed out my booking to Voyama which spelled my name wrong. They refused to reissue my ticket with the correct spelling so I had to sweat out getting on board the airlines and now I have to sweat it out today because they again refused to reissue the ticket" Pros: "Everything, thank you. See you next time. The best airplane" Pros: "I traveled this time with my wife and 8 year old twin daughters. For the long haul flight from Boston to HongKong, they let all families with children (including us) board earlier, which not all airlines do, and which was much appreciated. It wasn't as big of a deal for the HongKong to Taipei puddle jumper. Crew was very attentive, responding rapidly to calls and rebooting the entertainment system when needed. They were also quick with providing water and ramen noodles when we needed them. Seats were OK, a little short on leg room on the 777, better on the Airbus 350's. In flight entertainment options were very good for the adults, decent for the kids (they seemed to be struggling to find things to watch)." Cons: "Food options are disappointing. The congee breakfasts have insipid, watery rice and dull flavored savories, and the sausage-and-egg breakfasts aren't much better. Dinner options were also disappointing, with so-so pepper beef and chicken that was not much past good. Snack options mid-flight were OK; they were generous with potato chips, caramel popcorn, chocolate and cookies, but the apples were mealy and there wasn't much in the way of healthy snack options." Pros: "The excellent service offered by the Cabin Manager, Amy and her team. They cared about the needs of the passengers in the 15-hr long flight and responded quickly to requests raised by passengers." Cons: "Seats to small! Food subpar! I’ll stick with Korean Air in future!" Pros: "Efficiency of Operations, efficiency of service and attitude to pleasing customers, great choice of movies, excellent aircraft" Cons: "For two hours flight food was adequate" Pros: "Comfortable seat" Cons: "Poor food and very basic (old movies) entertainment - always delayed" Korean Air8.7 Singapore Airlines8.6 Qatar Airways8.2 Delta7.9 Cathay Pacific8.0 Book cheap flights from Boston to Bangkok Recent one-way flight deals Only flying one-way?
