Pros: "Crew were very nice and accommodating. Chocolate always appreciated!" Cons: "The passenger in front of me slammed into my knees. I am very tall. She was not but she sure got her seat back as far as possible in spite of having he bulkhead sear, so I had to be careful of my position the rest of the flight" Pros: "Food was ok" Cons: "AC was not turned on until flight was up in air. That means for 30 minutes passengers were sweating sitting in a suffocating cabin. Crew refused to give Green Tea, saying only available in business class Inflight screen size was very small ...5-6 inches only" Cons: "You could have had my luggage arrive. Now I don’t know where it is" Pros: "Crew was very nice and responsive." Cons: "The flight was so hot. No personal air controls. Economy was horribly small." Pros: "Thank you for waiting for us. We were delayed. I appreciate not missing our flight." Cons: "Guy behind me kept asking for a seat upgrade and when they didn’t oblige spent the whole 11hours kicking the back of my chair in protest. I understand this isn’t the crews’ fault. But maybe the bid upgrade for seats isn’t the best system?" Cons: "This flight was poorly advertised as Economy Light. I had to pay $500 in baggage fees to being one checked ski bag round trip - more than the cost of my entire fare!" Cons: "There was only one agent checking in business class passengers until a bunch of us complained. The Swiss business lounge is too small with not enough seats" Pros: "Everyone was friendly, pleasant and very helpful. Upon arrival in Delhi our suitcase handle was broken." Overall a good flight. Good food and super nice staff. flight was cancelled at an hour's notice- it appears that when flights are not full, customers are left to fend for themselves. I missed my one and only conference in 6 years, and the 900$ charge was not refundable. After every passenger was boarded the captain announced that the lavatory had to be cleaned. We waited a half hour for that to be done before we finally took off. Nothing was offered in the way of drinks or snacks while we bided our time. Otherwise,the flight itself was uneventful. Food was not nice.It’s not only my opinion but the opinion of many.People were seen grumbling.During the trip from Delhi to Montreal the food was nice.Except for this everything was nice. The meal service could have been better for a 14 hours flight especially in business class Very comfortable, good hospitality, staff very helpful. Good Indian food . Had a peaceful sleep throughout Pros: "Air Canada is always a great travel experience." Cons: "The food is terrible. It's the worst I've had from any airline." Pros: "Good movies" Cons: "Flight took 3 hours longer than expected and they lost the baggage of me and 50+ other travellers" Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "2 hour delay because of rain west jet and porter were on time but air canada delayed My seat was apparently broken had a window seat with no one else in my row and then I was placed ina Center seat although other options were open The attendant comes on the air and says they need to manually start the engine one by one because the electric start to make it easy was not working All and all not a pleasant experience at all" Cons: "My problem is when United uses Air Canada the privileges that United gives don't exist and they treat you like anyone else...
