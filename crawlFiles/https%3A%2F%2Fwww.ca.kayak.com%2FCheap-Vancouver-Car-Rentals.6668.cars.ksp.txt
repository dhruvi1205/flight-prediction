KAYAK’s top tips for renting a car in Vancouver Revered as the "Hollywood of the North" and ranked as the 3rd most livable place in the world, Vancouver makes for an ideal road trip. You're in for a treat, from the stunning architecture to natural beauty, including a culture heavily influenced by immigrants from Great Britain, France, Ireland, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean. To ensure hassle-free travels, split driving time by having an additional driver to your Vancouver cheap car rental reservation. While fees may vary by company, additional drivers must personally appear at the rental counter to present a valid driving license and pay the average daily fee. Young Driver Vancouver car rentals are very popular with young revelers traveling as a group and want to book a passenger van, economy, midsize, full-size, minivan, or SUV vehicles. Bear in mind that the minimum age to rent a car in Vancouver is 21, with mandatory surcharges for renters under 25 years. When researching car rental agencies through a search aggregate like KAYAK, do your due diligence and read through the terms and conditions and vehicle rental contract page to make informed decisions on age requirements, rental period, acceptable payment methods, available cars and more. When booking online or picking up your rental car at Vancouver International Airport (VIA), ask for optional extras such as a child safety seat, pre-paid fueling, navigation system, etc. While the roads in Vancouver are well-marked, it's a good idea to have a satellite navigation device when you want to map out your route or find various local attractions along the way. A GPS is ideal when you need the quickest, most-direct scenic routes and will save you time and money by suggesting alternative roads when there's a traffic delay. The North Shore mountain range provides a picture perfect backdrop to the city of Vancouver -- visiting them during your travels is a must. Renting a car will give you the ability to access the mountain range and a long list of adventure activities. Having a car will give you the ability to go skiing or snowboarding on the world-renowned Cypress Mountain, or explore the spectacular views that hikes across Grouse Mountain and Mount Seymour have to offer. Picking up a rental car at Vancouver International Airport (VIA) could not be simpler; rental company counters are located next to the baggage claim at both the Main and South terminals. VIA is conveniently located only 9 miles from downtown and you will arrive after approximately 30 minutes of driving. Distances and speed limits are measured in kilometers throughout Canada, so be careful and adjust your driving to suit. Vancouver has numerous flashing green traffic lights, which mean you have the right to drive through the intersection but must approach cautiously and yield to pedestrians who may be crossing. Many cyclists are present on Vancouver roads, so it’s important to keep an active eye on your blind spots. Keep in mind that across the city there are some roads with separated bike lanes and roads where lanes are shared; be mindful in both situations to provide cyclists with a safe amount of room. Like most major cities, rush hour in Vancouver can be frustrating and it is wise to avoid major arterial roads or driving altogether between 5 pm and 7 pm. Traffic can be especially bad on West Georgia Street in the evening and it is advisable to seek an alternative route. Also keep in mind that the bridges of Vancouver, such as the Alex Fraser, can clog up with congestion during peak times and, due to their narrow entries and exits, take a long time to open up again. 25% of our users found rental cars in Vancouver for C$ 44 or less Book your rental car in Vancouver at least 1 day before your trip in order to get a below-average price Off-airport rental car locations in Vancouver are around 2% cheaper than airport locations on average Mini rental cars in Vancouver are around -62% cheaper than other car types, on average Vancouver car rental experiences: the best tips from KAYAK users Insights shared by verified travelers who rented a car in Vancouver Learn how KAYAK collects reviews and tips from users.

On your website it doesn't mention the $30/day for insurance on top of the rental charge. I was led to believe at booking everything was included. Too expensive.

Arrived at 8 to find no one there, had to call and ask for someone to help me out. I reserved the car at a specific time for a reason, and I wasn’t getting out of there with the car until after 9. A bit ridiculous in my eyes, Such a lack of care to their costumers. Oh wait there’s more. I bought insurance prior on kayak, but not straight from rent-a-car. Resulting in them withholding a massive fee on my credit card and saying I owe them nearly a grand to replace a windshield because of a tiny chip in the windshield due to driving on the highway. I’ve rented cars before and have never dealt with this kind of thing. No windshield replacement should be that much, and the chip is so minor it could easily be filled for very cheap. But instead rent a car is money grabbing and taking advantage of me. In the process of trying to figure out my claim with the third party insurance, which of course has not been easy. All in all I’m extremely upset by my experience and would recommend you go else where to rent a car. Cons:Don’t rent from here! 2.0 Poor May 2022When we arrived the place, there was no car!

I asked to add the insurance a couple of time and they never got it done. I called to change the car since we didn't order a basic mini suv, but I needed to go to Richmond to make the change. The car was very dirty and damaged and the tires were not great. The value was good but I'm now dealing with the customer service again for the return. They asked me to pay for the damages when a claim was sent to my insurance company since they couldn't do it properly with their insurance the first time around. 4.0 Mediocre Sep. 2023I booked to pick up the car in Vancouver downtown at 9 a.m. But when I arrived, the staff told me the car was not available in Vancouver downtown but in Richmond. I ended up picking up the car in Richmond at almost 11 a.m. Poor management. 4.0 Mediocre Aug. 2023Didn't have any cars when I arrived on time. Took about an hour and a half to wait for someone to return a car and have it briefly cleaned. The inside was not cleaned at all and was quite filthy.
