Flight from Los Angeles to Tokyo Narita Airport FAQs - booking Japan flights If I am traveling with children to Japan, are there any child seat laws I should know about when renting a car in this country? There is a national child restraint law in this country that states that any child up to four years old needs to travel in a forward-facing car seat and that kids up to six years old need to travel in a booster seat or on a booster cushion. If I plan on flying to Tokyo, which airport should I fly to? Most travelers flying to Tokyo will choose the Haneda Airport (HND) because it offers a location that is closer to the center of Tokyo. That said, some of the cheapest flights available from the west coast of the United States to Tokyo travel to Narita International Airport (NRT). Another one of the advantages of this airport is that it offers abundant rail service to get travelers not really into the center of Tokyo but to a number of other destinations that surround this large city. If I want to travel to Sapporo in the north of Japan, what are some of the best choices for flights? When flying to the New Chitose Airport (CTS) that serves Sapporo from cities on the west coast of the United States, some of the quickest options are the one-stop flights from San Francisco International Airport (SFO) aboard ANA Airlines. What are some transportation options to get from Haneda Airport into downtown Tokyo? The Tokyo Monorail travels from the airport to the downtown area in around 23 minutes, with trains departing the airport every 10 minutes or so. There is also a bus service provided by Airport Limousine that can make the trip in around 40 minutes, with buses departing roughly every hour from the airport. Which airport should I use to visit Mt. Fuji? Mt. Fuji is the highest mountain in Japan, lying just below the center of Honshu island and south of Tokyo. If you intend to visit the area you can fly to Tokyo Haneda Airport and get a connecting flight to Mt. Fuji Shizuoka Airport, about 50 mi away from the peak. Which Tokyo airport is closer to the downtown area? Of the two international airports serving the Tokyo metropolitan area, Tokyo Haneda Airport is the closer to the city center which is a little less than 9 mi away. Tokyo Narita Airport lies about 37 mi from the center of the city, so plan your travel itinerary carefully when booking your flight from the US to Japan. Should I buy Japanese Yen before I leave the US? Most international travelers tend to buy local currency once they arrive at their destination and all the major Japanese airports have currency exchange offices where you can buy yen to pay for your taxi, rental car or to use public transportation. Do the Japanese airports have facilities for families? Yes, they do. All the international airports serving US flights provide facilities for parents traveling with children. These services include Baby Rooms equipped with changing tables and microwaves, nursing rooms for mothers with infants and Children’s Play Areas where the young ones can tire themselves out before the long flight home.

Passengers need to have a valid passport for their trip to Japan, and they need to ensure that their passport remains valid during the entire length of their stay in Japan. It is also important to keep one blank page in the passport for an entry stamp. A popular departure airport in the United States for a flight to Japan is Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). Passengers looking for the quickest way to get from downtown Los Angeles to this airport should travel on the FlyAway bus that travels from Union Station in downtown Los Angeles to the airport in about 40 minutes. Two of the biggest annual events in Japan are New Year's Day and Obon, which occur in the summer months. If traveling to Japan for either of these events, it is best to book tickets as far in advance as possible to ensure availability and the lowest prices. One of the largest international airlines in Japan is ANA Airlines, and most travelers might be surprised to learn that one of their major hubs in the United States is Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL), where passengers will find a number of nonstop flight options to a variety of cities in Japan. If you plan on traveling to the southern part of Japan, one of the most popular airport options is Nagasaki International Airport (NGS). There are a number of one-stop flight options available to this airport aboard both ANA Airlines and Japan Airlines from a variety of cities in the United States. US citizens do not require a visa to visit Japan, but permanent residents should check online with the nearest Japanese embassy or consulate to see if one is required for their respective countries. Bear in mind that you will be allowed to stay for up to 90 days. The Japanese capital city of Tokyo is served by two major airports: Tokyo Narita (NRT) and Tokyo Haneda (HND), which handle most of the international air traffic, but flights from the US to Japan also use Osaka Kansai Int’l (KSI) as well as Fukuoka Airport (FUK) and Okinawa Naha (OKA), so choose the one which is closest to your destination. Japan has four main islands in very close proximity to each other. The northern island of Hokkaido is not serviced by international flights from the US, so you’ll have to get a connecting flight from one of the two Tokyo hubs or use another form of surface transportation in order to get there. Due to their geographic location many of the flights from the US to Japan originate on the West Coast, where you can get several flights with connections from Los Angeles (LAX), San Francisco (SFO) or Seattle (SEA). The only nonstop flights to Japan are from the Hawaiian city of Honolulu (HNL) to Osaka via Air Asia X. Osaka has excellent ferry connections to the many southern Japanese cities like Miyazaki and Okinawa, but if you wish to visit the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki then you should use Fukuoka Airport, which is midway between them and therefore is a perfect launching point.

I will look for Japan air for any flights I take in the future." Cons: "Nothing. The experience for international economy was perfect." Pros: "the Level of service and the Japanese culture was evident at every moment of this flight. Our boarding process was delayed by almost an hour, and it felt like every 5-10 minutes we had an update as to what was going on and why, then passports were checked early, and service was top notch." Cons: "In my perfect world, we would have updates way in advance if there are mechanical or airport issues but that is a slim to none chance. That is about it. Everything else was amazing!" Pros: "The crew" Cons: "The foods could be better not up to the standard of EVA air on economy class" Pros: "The staff were fantastic nothing was too much trouble and great fun attitudes." Cons: "No entertainment systems." Cons: "No space for cabin bags. Late by 2 hours. Super rude and passive aggressive staff. Kept in bus at Frankfurt for 10 mins. Won’t fly BA again if i can help it." Pros: "Sitting in my seat I felt that I had wiggle room for my feet and my arms/elbows. Usually on American flights, I feel like a sardine packed in a can. Even though I was in economy I had plenty of space and was very comfortable during 9 hour flight from BKK to Tokyo." Cons: "The attendants were very pleasant and efficient. I will certainly prefer to fly JAL, especially if you could offer the lower rates. On the down side, it was very difficult to contact their customer service line. However their online help desk was very responsive." Pros: "They were every where all the time! No sitting around in the back like most airlines. Movies Hallie and many first run and Oscar nominated." Pros: "Everything!!! Excellent customer service. Will definitely use their airlines whenever possible.Very polite and always smiling and frequently checks on you if u need anything unlike other airlines." Cons: "None whatsoever." Pros: "customer service spoke English" Cons: "1) when my flight was delayed significantly due to weather, I was not notified until I got to the airport 2) when the same flight was cancelled, I was on hold with JAL for over an hour before I could speak with customer service\ 3) customer service could not rebook me for another flight until 3 whole days later 4) I had to look on JAL's website and inform their customer service about flight options that were somewhat sooner 5) no compensation was offered for 2 days of delays and flying out of another city (I paid for my own transport to this other city in order to make my final destination on time)" Pros: "Crew was amazing, food was filling & plentiful." Cons: "Overall no complaints but the landing in Tokyo was a little rough. Pilot seemed to descend quickly which hurt my ears but otherwise, smooth flight." Cons: "We did not make this flight and had to take the train instead" Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "After they told about change my flight to Asiana I finally agreed but I had to walk by myself to Asiana, ANA couldnt at least to make the changes to avoid me long time to stand in line by asiana airlines. I would never recomend ANA" Pros: "Staff and crew were great. Very accommodating." Cons: "I unfortunately got placed in the middle of one large person and one person who had a strong body odor. Unfortunate but it happens." Pros: "Loved that they offered us ANA postcards on the flight in to send home. I loved that they gave the kids inflatable ANA airplanes. Loved that they were accommodating with our Carry on luggage" Pros: "Pleasant crew, good food. Standard flight as one would expect." Cons: "The food was dreadful. It was like being back in the 1990s. Kids entertainment options were poor. The original toy story movie was it!" Cons: "Flight attendant didn't mention so well about drink service." Pros: "The crews on ANA (Flight Attendants) are the hardest working, most polite and service oriented of ANY carrier I can remember. When the cabin lights are ON, the crew is hustling to keep the passengers occupied and chewing. Free Beer, Wine and mixed drinks in Coach! Every Service - Snack, Drinks, Lunch, Dinner, Coffee/Tea, Second and Third rounds of drinks includes a cold towel to wipe your face and hands and most important, trash is collected promptly EVERY single time. WOW. I noticed that Flight Attendants take notes on sleeping passengers for every major meal service, and they take the time to revisit those customers when awake to check they might have wanted to be fed. I also noticed that the crew has special double sided tape to pickup crumbs and spills in the aisles so grime is not tracked into the carpet. Dont be surprized to see a flight attendant cruising the aisle after dinner with a soft cooler full of small vanilla Hagen Daz cups..." Cons: "We flew from Bangkok to Washington Dulles with a connection in Tokyo. Snow in Japan caused crew shifts to max out and ultimately a dramatic change in flight departure. (Guaranteeing a missed connection) This caused multiple downstream challenges. 1. Original flight was scheduled for 00:30. (Half Past Midnight), rescheduled flight was scheduled for 12:30 (Half Past Noon) For Americans unused to a 24 hour clock, this made emails From ANA very difficult to wrap your mind around. Was it a typo? What happens when you miss your connection? (Turns out weather delays do NOT result in accommodations or meals being provided) Rescheduled flight should have been for 1231 with (AM/PM in Parentheses) 2. For passengers who spent their vacation/trip near the equator, the prospect of spending the night in snowbound Tokyo was simply not addressed in the cancellation email. The better option was to stay in your original point of origin and make the connection in one day, but email has NO telephone number for passengers to call to make these arrangements. (We ended up calling a toll California telephone number to be sure we got an English speaking agent) 3. Many SE Asian departing cities have a crazy baggage weight policy that allows for Two bags of 25 Kilos each , but if you have a single bag that weights 32 Kilos, you must pay excess baggage. Although the policy may NOT be specific to ANA, there are hundreds of folks of all nationalities repacking suitcases on the floor of the airport, to try to meet the regulations. As a traveler I understand this, but as an ANA customer it makes no sense, especially when the ticket agent cannot charge the overage to a credit card at the ticket counter. Instead sending you to a different location then waiting for you to return with a receipt. Its a huge scam and ANA can do better communicating the rules to passengers via email or their web site. Nothing starts a long trip off worse than arguments over arcane rules. 4. Changing a return flight arrangement as a result of weather happens at the last moment, but seat assignments apparently could not keep up. I would rather NOT fly than face a center seat in coach for 14 hours. I cannot explain what happened, but repeated attempts at advance check in showed NO assigned seats available, the ticket and gate agents could not improve on this, but BOTH flights ended up having empty seats and in the end we stressed for nothing. ANA must be able to do better, improving their IT systems to make advance seat assignments possible no matter how challenging the problem of "equipment" and other changes in the face of a canceled flight." Pros: "Staff were friendly from check in to disembark. Food was quite good. Boarded on time and people were accomodating of one another in the entry and exit process." Cons: "I was travelling with my twin 11 yr olds one of whom has limited sight. They normally only allow early boarding of young children, but we need extra time as I have 2 children to organise and my daughters sight dictates that i have to assist her. Other passengers were not impressed. I would like the airlines to take the initiative to have all children boarded early as if we board with everyone else, the aisles will be blocked as my children try to get organised." Een prijsvechter, dus dat moet je ook verwachten. Voor alles moet je betalen. We hebben vooraf een maaltijd en een amenitiesset besteld. Die kregen we netjes uitgereikt aan boord. Het is BYOD voor het amusement tijdens de vlucht en dit werkte uitstekend. Geen trage wifi, helemaal niet. Alles kost geld, zelfs een flesje water. Misschien op langere vluchten wel gratis water, thee, koffie. Maar daarentegen mag je na de security je lege drinkflessen gewoon vullen en mee aan boord nemen Wifi could have been better. Arrived 55 mins earlier than scheduled :) Best part are two crying babies throughout the whole 11 hour trip Clean and comfortable cabin. Friendly on board service. No vegetarian food options and movie options were very limited. Internet was very slow I didn’t eat the food but there wasn’t an option. Seat was a little too small for me but everything else was great Never again on Zipair. People please spend a little extra to fly on better airlines. After all, it’s your vacation! No screen TV, internet sucks. You can’t change or modify anything after purchasing your tickets, Our friends tried to change from paying for carryon to checking in bags. No no no, you’d have to pay for whatever the check in bags cost. Myself, change my mind and continue to travel to other destinations after Japan. The only refund they were going to paying me back was $67.00 tax? So I’ve decided to just let my family use the extra seats and take my carry on back with them. At Narita airport, they’re not allowed my husband to my carry on back with them although I’ve already paid for. He end up have to paid $50.00 to check in that bag? You tell me, do you want to travel with Zipair? Hell no! Inflight WiFi would lose connection when you don't continuously use it, and would sometimes be difficult to reconnect. Food quality could be a bit better. Other than that, it was excellent. i requested refund and among $800 i got refunded 100 bucks :) how can it be possible? Staff didn't speak much English but were attentive. Not one time was I offered a snack or complimentary drink. English on the website detailing items allowed in checked bag or carry-on could have been more clear. In flight WiFi had errors, cut out, and needed to constantly reconnect. Flew Business Class that gave me privileges at the Maple Leaf Lounge which I was looking forward to as this was the Saturday before Thanksgiving, but LGA was quiet. Regardless, the Maple Leaf Lounge was really tranquil and relaxing, sto=cked with a large breakfast selection that had 2 omelettes, sauteed onions and peppers to throw on them, really good bacon, delicious fingerling potatoes, oatmeal with a big variety of garnishes, fresh fruit and cheese, bagels, muffins and other continental items. There was a good coffee machine with terrific espresso (EVEN DECAF ESPRESSO), cans and pitchers of juice, soda amchine and beer taps. By the time I left they had switched the fruit out for salad in advance of lunch and it look like a thorough selection with chicken. The view of the gates and fray below added tot he cocoon I felt I was in. I would pay to do it again and it definitely added to it. For the two flights I was on (to YYZ connecting to YQB) I was served a nice cheese and fruit plate even though they were about an hour. Impressively, on te shorter YYZ to YQB leg I was served warm nuts as well as a hot towel. I only get that when flying long flights on a lie flat seat on the American legacy carriers. Service was warm, welcoming and just made me feel wonderful. I would consider Air Canada for any destination if price were competitive based on the great service. When my plane landed in Toronto, deplaning was delayed due to terminal security issue. I had a somewhat tight connection flight to St. Vincent, and no one from Air Canada ground crew made any effort to notify my connection flight gate of the issue although I plead with several ground crew members to notify desk at departing gate. The three hour delay, and the 5 gate changes left us very frustrated along with that was the fact that I was wheel chair reliant and for 3 of the five gate changes I had no assistance or wheel chair. My new knees are hurting miserably. To add injury to all the frustration only after most food places closed did Air Canada offer each of us a whopping $15.00 food voucher. Good only in Canada at a Canadian airport for one year. I think the plane that they changed at last minute could be better Short flight. Wonderful crew, snacks and wine (business class). No entertainment but not at all needed on short flight. No negatives. Our wait to Fort Lauderdale was THREE hours! Our return flight(we switched to the 11:05flight),so that we didn't have to wait 13 hours for the 9:35 flight. I think it's TERRIBLE that I was charged over $ 450!!!! WHY??? The plane had seats available and it cost Air Canada NOTHING!!! It seems that greed NOY customer care is prioritized with AIR CANADA. That was after we already paid for TWO suitcases when we had ONLY ONE !!! It will be ALONG time before we fly with this carrier. Westjet is a great alternative. The lady sitting beside me bought a sandwich for $10.50 and threw most of it away. Gone are the days when we got what we paid for,INSTEAD of being ripped off. Mary Warkentin As a United 1K member I was expecting a lot better service than what I got. I had to pay extra to pick seats, pay for baggage (only the Star Alliance Gold has one free baggage allowance) etc. All in all with all the extra fees, I would have been buying the ticket on United which was about $75 more expensive than the Air Canada fare. Pros: "Roomier seats overall, the headrest screens and USB ports are great!" Cons: "We paid extra for seats with more leg room and got the same as everyone else. Why the charge? Our departure was delayed. The plane had some sort of fragrance regularly coming thru the ventilation that irritated my sinuses and made me ill. The water for the only service on the flight (for coach anyway) was warm and tasted odd. Cabin temperature was too warm (multiple logical arguments can be made for cooler temps over warmer)" Pros: "Nothing positive" Cons: "I was stranded in TO for 12 hours without a hotel room because of Air Canada inefficiency and horrible customer service! I’m never flying AC again if there’s any other airlines flying to my destination" Pros: "Quiet night flight, friendly service and ok entertainment." Cons: "No surprise but food definitely nothing special, disliked big fees for baggage." Pros: "Punctuation, friendliness, cleanliness and the advantage of having a plug to charge my phone" Cons: "More snacks" Pros: "Team worked well together." Cons: "Could not figure out how to plug in ac for my device. An educational label would help." Cons: "The lady at the boarding gate at newark airport was extremely unpolite and with a very law service attitude" Pros: "what's there ever to like in United? One things is worse than the other!" Cons: "Flight was delayed 1 hour for crew not showing up. contacted customer service 2 times on phone and was promised to get travel voucher in 24-48 hours. Never got that. On 3rd time contact I was asked to email their support I did one week ago and nobody bothered to respond yet. Typical United!" Pros: "Throughout delay the pilot kept us informed. Great selection of movies. Food was decent." Cons: "We were delayed twice for several hours total." Cons: "My flight was rescheduled, so I ended up waiting about a 12 hour delay in Germany" Pros: "United combined two half full flights, left us on the plane waiting for the second flight passengers to load" Cons: "Yet another United flight delay and cancellation.United combined two half full flights, left us on the plane waiting for the second flight passengers to load" Pros: "Short flight, nothing to do with airline" Cons: "Boarding was annoying and employees were rude. Had just gotten off of a connecting United flight and one of the employees barked at me that my carry on was too big and I had to close extra zipper even though I had no issues in the United flight I had just gotten off of......... I was starving and didn’t get a chance to grab food due to short layover time. We took a while to take off. We’re supposed to leave at 4:15 and left closer to 5pm. Then when we were on the air, flight attendants took a while to provide the snacks and water and they didn’t even get around to our row before they had to sit down for touch down. Smh. Terrible and thoughtless. Seats were uncomfortable and very little leg space. Entertainment only works if you’re able to download their app and of course no free WiFi because airlines want to force you to spend more money after you’ve spent a large amount to fly to your destination." Pros: "Nothing." Cons: "I was exiting your airplane bathroom and my wife was entering when the flight attendant placed her arm in front of my wife and said, “I’m sorry but I’m working so that means I have dibs on this bathroom.” She then entered the bathroom and shut the door on my wife’s face. I was furious and speechless to witness such frank rude behavior and horrible customer service. I would like to think that United Airlines prides itself on better customer service than this. My wife and I have other choices when we fly and we will certainly think twice before we fly United Airlines again." Pros: "Well, I got there." Cons: "Purchased economy plus bundle. United employee closed gate in my face at ORD. United Club toilets were filthy and the worst of my problems was the ridiculous selection of teas. (Toilets outside of United Club much cleaner.) I had an economy plus seat, but this did not allow me to board early. So I boarded late and there was no seat in front of me. So I could not put my carry on in front of me. I asked if I could put my bag in top, but attendant told me that I had to ask the first class person in front of me for a favor and thank them for the favor. I did. But this was one of the more disgusting experiences that I have had on an airplane and I paid an extra 100 USD for the privilege of it."
