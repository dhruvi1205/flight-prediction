I had ordered asian vegetarian meal but the food lacked any flavor. Choices of entertainment was also very limited. emirates is way better in terms of food and entertainment. Was humiliated at Doha airport, treaded like a cattle class traveler, I hold platinum pro status with AA and I don’t fly economy even domestic but was made to travel in the middle seat in economy class and boarding zone 3 and was denied lounge access at Doha airport.

The other check-in crew members told us (5 total) to go together to board the plane then this female staff told us we can only have one family member go in with my mom (to take care of the wheelchair then assist her on the plane) next time we board the plane. Their messages are inconsistent & her attitude was uncalled for, especially when she let other disabled passengers on with their more than one family members & the other Asiana staff members told us to go in at the same time."

Pros: "The food is so good." Cons: "The check in counter is not fully organized. I encounter so much delay in checking in my luggage. The new employee must be properly assisted by the old personnel to avoid long hours of waiting and standing in the counter of the passengers who arrived early so they can check in their baggage ahead of time. I availed of your web check in but was waiting for so long in the check in counter." Pros: "The seat layout" Cons: "The seat belt very short on one side hard to operate" Pros: "The crew."

Even Frontier Airlines at least offers a meal voucher for del" Pros: "Fact that there’s a flight available to get me-from a to b, Crew were friendly-great, cabins clean." Cons: "Expensive, Delayed flight, unable to hear and understand boarding announcements, No WiFi, and a magazine that caters to the top 5% of passengers. Then to top it off a lost bag and over 2.0 hours spent either on hold or awaiting a call back to resolve issues with my last bag-totally unacceptable" Pros: "The ability to charge my cell phone via USB ports. Also the movies on long flights is really nice" Cons: "Quicker way to get off plane" Pros: "Crew was great seats comfortable but quite near back my connecting flight I had to get my seat when I got to the airport I was second from the back but close to washrooms" Cons: "There was no entertainment on second flight but I didn’t use it anyway On second flight washroom was not very good my scarfe dropped on the floor and was wet and yuckie" Pros: "We missed the connection because the Istanbul airport is a silent airport and no announcement were made for boarding." Cons: "Announcement from crew or reach out to people in front of gate would help. Also, the staff at Istanbu airport is so rude and have no respect for customers." Cons: "We were not allowed to board our connecting flight and are stranded currently at the Istanbul airport and had to book our next flight with indigo as the staff closed the boarding ahead of time even though we were on time. Lot of shouting and crying by other passengers happening for the same reason." Pros: "NOTHING!" Cons: "Too exhausted from the long flight. But really wanted to say - Never flying them again after my itinerary is completed. They have just lost any revenue they would ever have gained from me in the future." Cons: "I will never forget Turkish airlines again. They stole our money. We were at our flight on time but they wouldn't let us board. They then said we were no shows and cancelled all our remaining flights with no refund. This ended up costing us around $3000. We don't have this kind of money and I don't know how we will pay rent next month." Pros: "The planets and stars we're aligned to provide an optimal trip. Price was a huge determinant for me...$800 RT Houston to Delhi just can't be beat. And, their arrival time into Delhi is so early (5: 20 am) that customs and immigration is a breeze." Cons: "All good." Pros: "Crew was nice and attentive to needs. I arrived safely at my destination so that’s all that matters." Cons: "My first flight was delayed at CAI and no one informed us of this. I almost missed my connecting flight." Cons: "Turkish Air lot my suitcase. I will never travel with them again" Pros: "Service from the crew at boarding and during the flight" Cons: "The touch screen are old and not responding to the touch . Make it a little bit hard to watch, also quality is low." Pros: "The food was better than on the flight from LA. But wine was bad to say the least. Rest same as in the Flight from LA." Cons: "The same as above and misguided by crew with regards to connecting flight. We had a bad time catching this connection. Even after disembarking the crew outside sent us on a wild goose chase. Airline representatives should be informed and helpful, which was not the case. Insufficient helping of food. Poor quality of wine and Vodka." Cons: "Delhi International Airport: Unhelpful representatives at both: Baggage Claim and at Operations center."
