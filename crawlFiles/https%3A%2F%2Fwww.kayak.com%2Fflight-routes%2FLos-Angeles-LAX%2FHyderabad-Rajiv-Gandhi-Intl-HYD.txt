Funny guys, why the have flight people inside the plane :) domestic airlines are always joke compared to the world domestic or overseas...." Pros: "The crew was great and entering and exiting the plane was quick." Cons: "The seats could have been more comfortable, but I feel like that is a comment for most planes that fly internationally." Pros: "The coach seats were larger than seats for domestic flights. The windows were dimmable for optimal lighting." Cons: "The armrests did not go up all the way, which made it difficult to maximize comfort with my travel partner." Cons: "The crew members could have been more courteous to clients on the flight by lowering their voices when conversating among themselves." Pros: "Crew was attentive and informative of delays" Cons: "This was American Airlines .. my Bags came out late even though i was in Biz Class" Pros: "Crew was amazingly nice, friendly and very helpful..." Cons: "The 767 business class seat from Tokyo to Jakarta could be better. Movies and other entertainment needs more variety. Not enough movies..." Pros: "The window shades were so cool. Seat was small but fairly comfortable and I like the foot rest." Cons: "No vegetarian options on the main meal menu" Pros: "The flight attendants were very attentive and polite, seats are some of the most comfortable of any airline I've flown (particularly compared to the US domestics), entertainment is solid (although the English movie selection was not that large), and we were regularly offered food and drink if we were awake. I would definitely recommend JAL to others." Cons: "The food was not to my liking (i.e., all Japanese style, but not necessarily types that appeal more to Westerners) but it was palatable." Pros: "That I probably won’t have to deal with AA for a while." Cons: "The boarding process was a joke. No seat assignments until the last second. The front desk personnel would not help us with a seat assignment and said they were “working on it”. I sat down with my wife in the waiting area and observed the front desk personnel joking around with each other for the next 45 minutes before the flight. Very unprofessional and not helpful. Not a good way to represent your airline." Pros: "Food wasn’t bad and flight crew were polite Flight took off around the time intended. Boarded and deplaned passengers quickly" Cons: "Flight was too warm for 11hrs and I had to ask for temp to be reduced. Very stuffy Didn’t have sparkling water after 4hrs or ginger ale" Pros: "Singapore Airlines has everything worked out for you before you land. That's a great help. The stewardesses were just phenomenal and endlessly polite. I will definitely use them again." Cons: "As much as I normally nitpick something, I literally have no criticism at all of Singapore Airlines. Everything they did was a step above everyone else." Cons: "Flight was a little warm but was able to get it cooler via help from crew but got warmer again towards the end of flight. Overall good flight though" Pros: "I liked the size of the cups for drinks: smaller than usual." Cons: "You could train some of your crews to behave more polite to the customers like they do in the Japanese airlines. Male crews tended to be nicer than female crews." Cons: "The lunch part at the end was a little late we had just had a snack and a small sandwich so we didn't eat a lot. But food was great!" Pros: "Flight was full but crew was attentive and very pleasant. Star Alliance Lounge at LAX had a good variety of food and drinks - Asian, western, small bites, snacks; red, white, bubbly and even a bartender who'll mix up cocktails. I love flying SQ." Cons: "For a premium economy service, it was really good." Pros: "The crew was lackluster; unusual for Singapore Airlines. Tall individuals will not like the business class seats." Pros: "The inflight entertainment was great, lots of movie selections" Cons: "The leg room was horrible. Honestly the worst space I've ever had in a flight. I was shocked considering Singapore air is considered one of the best airlines" Pros: "They treated you like you were important and really took care of my every need" Cons: "Getting on a cattle car to go to another terminal and then get in line again to go on the plane" Pros: "Crew was very friendly and responsive to my needs. They met it with a smile." Pros: "I loved everything! The plane was well maintained, the crew were friendly and attentive, the flight was comfortable even for such long hours. Food was also great!

Excellent service. Great food, entertainment, and flight. Nothing went wrong. Thank you!" Pros: "Leg room and friendly staff" Cons: "Child’s meal does not have vegetarian option, this must be included as it makes not sense in not having this option." Pros: "Everything during the flight was lovely" Cons: "But what I really didn’t like was the service they provided at the checking desk in LAX, the staff was a kind of unfriendly. In my opinion they should provide an excellent customer service, but everything I noticed there was unsatisfactory, I love to fly with Emirates but such things will make everyone disappointed." Pros: "Everything other than food" Cons: "While they gave good AVML food on DXB-HYD flight, not sure what stops them from repeating it on SFO-DXB flight., It was worst to the end." Cons: "Emirates charging for duty free merchandise bought in Dubai. It is ridiculous that they add the weight of the duty free merchandise to your carry on luggage and charge at the gate. If I have known that I could have shopped in Dubai duty free. The customer service person was very rude too." Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "Super delayed !! Delayed time is longer than flying time. What the heck !!" Cons: "they have changed how they serve drinks and food. they used to do that separately. now they club it together." I liked the menu. Cres were nice. But the seats are very uncomfortable. Got back ache Also no leg space at all. . Food, entertainment and blankets are minimum requirements for an international flight with a duration of 3+ hrs. None was in this flight and very dirty bathrooms on the top of it. Too many baby crying, customer and staff yelling at each other. Seat is too small and tight. Could not sleep at all for 16 hour flight ! Pros: "Great crew, excellent staff at the airport. Planes were nice and comfortable. Food was ok. They have an excellent price to quality ratio; you can often get great prices on some of the more popular destinations and the service is 5 stars." Cons: "Some alcoholic drinks" Pros: "The portion for LAX to Doha was fairly comfortable and crew was helpful.. they kept running out of meal options by the time they reached us mid flight .. Doha to Bengaluru portion was less classy— the TV/ remotes etc didn’t work well and overall service not as good .." Cons: "Unorganized too shaky flight made me sick to stomach ,foods are not good service not good" Pros: "Crew was amazing and aircraft was clean and seats comfortable!" Cons: "I would like to have more air fresheners during the flight as there are some people who eat special food and it smells so bad in aircraft" Pros: "food ok, economy seats not too bad" Cons: "old entertainment system. Tight connection and first flight was late, so we got bumped off our connection (they literally removed our names from the flight, even though we could've sprinted through the airport and made it if they waived the 20 minute before departure gate closure). It was an exhausting and long wait for the next flight and I did not think it was well-handled. Staying in a hotel is not a great option, because it takes 2 hours to get out of the airport, another 2 hours cushion to get back in time." Pros: "I had a family emergency and couldn’t go. I wasn’t allowed to switch my flight or change it. Lots of money spent with nothing in return. Unfortunte." Pros: "Service basically. For such a long haul flight they did everything they could to make it comfortable." Cons: "They could have checked the bathrooms more often as trash bins were very full." Cons: "During flight after first meal the cabin temperature is way to cold. Then it gets warmer but later, second half of the flight the air gets very cold again so it’s difficult to have a good sleep." Cons: "Uncomfortable seats. Very uncomfortable ride. Everything else was good but it’s becoming hard to fly this way." Cons: "Plane was delayed and boarding was a bit confusing at the start but then quickly fixed" Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "Our first flight got delayed from lax and we missed our connection flight and they wouldn’t let us go on the next flight and instead we had to wait about 7 hours for the next flight!!! Also we got really bad seats on the other flight" Pros: "The crew was very attentive and pleasant to all business class passengers . The food and service were excellent and great presentation. Seats were comfortable and great for sleeping ." Cons: "There wasn’t anything that I can recall that made the trip unpleasant ." Pros: "Movies" Cons: "I had to rearrange my bags 3-4 times even though I paid $80 additional for extra weight" Cons: "Flight was late, I had to run like crazy to catch the second flight" Cons: "Flight was delayed by over an hour causing us to miss our connecting flight. Had to wait in the airport all night and no one from Turkish airlines did anything to help us or accommodate us during our unexpected overnight layover." Pros: "The food was decent" Cons: "Too crowded and hectic. Not enough leg room. (and I’m not even a tall person to begin with)" Pros: "food was good, and my business class seat was okay." Cons: "First flight (to Istanbul) delayed, and nobody cared to help with making connecting flight booked on the same Turkish Airlines (THY)! Different THY employees sent me to three (3) different places (with two suitcases in hand) at opposite ends of the huge Istanbul airport before finally pointing to the Business Lounge and causing my missing the connection. Had they directed me correctly and cared about my first delay, I would not have missed it. I lost the first-night pay at the hotel of my final destination, my friends lost their time and money on making trips to pick me up, my ailing relatives were in pieces worrying about me, and so on. In sum, a fun trip (NOT!) ... If you care for some details, here you go... They did not inform their own connecting flight about my delay. Despite issuing me a boarding pass, nobody was looking for me or announcing where I should go. I spent an hour running around the airport at THY employees' misdirections. Business Lounge revealed I was already issued a ticket for next morning's flight (without informing me via my email they had or otherwise). I then looked at their own monitor and saw a much earlier flight the same night on a partner airline. I had to point to that flight, and they issued me a ticket there. No apology, no offer of any compensation. I understand that flights may delay, and I could forgive an honest mistake in misdirection. But this was a wide-spread incompetence and utter unwillingness to help their own business class (!) customer. I can only imagine what pains the economy travelers had to endure! Just to give you a flavor, after realizing that my connecting flight was boarding (when my delayed first flight arrived in Istanbul), I asked the crew to direct me to the best route to my connection. They pointed to the gate personnel. The gate personnel who greeted us DID NOT KNOW about my connection and sent me to the opposite side of the airport without notifying the connecting flight to wait for me. No help/transport was offered. When I made my way to the connecting gate with my luggage, the flight was gone. Nobody to be found from THY around the gate. A neighboring THY gate's employee directed me to the "Care Point" desk far away. A sizable line emerged there, with only two agents working it. I asked one of them if business class was served there. They said, "Yes, get in line, please". After 30 minutes in that line, I approached a "Care Point" agent (a cruel name for no-care-whatsoever service) who told me "You need to go to the business class desk upstairs. Economy only here!" No apology, no expression of concern, yelling "Next!" when I told her that I wasted 30 minutes of valuable time in line at their direction and would appreciate her doing something to help or making sure I reach the right person.
