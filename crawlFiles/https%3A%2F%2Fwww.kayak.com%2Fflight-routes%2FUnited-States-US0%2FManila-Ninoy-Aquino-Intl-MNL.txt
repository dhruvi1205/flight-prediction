I was impressed. Very eager to assist flight crew First time on Starlux. I was impressed. Very eager to assist flight crew Premium Economy on Starlux- a worthwhile way to cross the Pacific. This is a great premium economy experience. The seats are comfortable, wide and provide decent foot rests. The seatback TV is large, high resolution and plenty of content. Bluetooth connection for your headset and control from your phone is available. Food was decent and in line with the cabin class. The seat could be improved by providing more lower leg support especially for taller guests (6ft myself). Cabin crew will be moving up and down the aisle a lot since the galley is in front. Screen size was nice. No vent when hot, food was not good Wish plane type had more restrooms… Care and consideration from stewards and stewardesses was so great I hope they never ran out of the menu choice one makes. They often do. Pros: "Just excellent. Excellent crew, excellent food, excellent aircraft, and excellent leg room. No recommendations." Cons: "I didnt get bulk head seats that are near the restroom for my disabled father. He had a terrible flight" Pros: "Crew and service were outstanding!" Cons: "I would have liked the ebooks section of the entertainment options expanded. I love to read and that would have greatly distracted from the discomfort of having to sit so long in such cramped quarters." Pros: "The crew that checked me and those who were onboard were very helpful and cheerful." Cons: "Better choices of movies on board." Pros: "The crew always smiles and very accomodating." Cons: "The main course could have been better or improve. I wasn’t satisfied with the taste." Cons: "Trip to Manila from Tokyo was delayed for 3hrs plus" Pros: "I did upgrade to economy premium which is why the flight was very comfortable. Would not have upgraded except I made a mistake in the currency conversion and thought the upgrade was cheaper than it was." Cons: "Did not really like the chef's cuisine as opposed to the one on my outward flight to Japan which was excellent." Pros: "was not able to board and was checked in 4 hours in advance" Cons: "Be able to select seats online within 24hours of flight for free" I was handled by some very rude CSA's in DFW. I was forced to check my carry-on as I was flying economy. You are now allowed only 10 kg total on all carry-on items. As my carry-on was 10 kg, and my backpack was 2 kg, I was made to check my luggage. I find this procedure unfair, as many other passengers in economy CLEARLY had more than 10 kgs. If KA insists this is their policy, then it should be enforced uniformly for everyone. TO INCLUDE Business and First Class. They are allowed 18 kg now. From my perspective....absolutely ridiculous. This was the first time in over 35 years I have been made to check my carry-on. I am EXTREMELY disappointed 😞 They let me board first because I'm a cancer patient & 75 years old. That was greatly helpful. Pros: "Everything was great!" Cons: "Some announcements were only made in Korean. Would have been nice to have it in English for international flight." Pros: "Very friendly staff with excellent service. Bottled water in every seat upon boarding. Lots of leg room, and love the outer earphones they provide!" Cons: "More movie selections" Pros: "Korean Air service was good." Cons: "When I left Atlanta for Incheon, I thought it was Korean Air, but I got on Delta Air Lines. I was a little embarrassed then." Pros: "The crew was very friendly, and I was happy to be seated in a 2-person row." Cons: "Nothing the crew could do- a lot of turbulence and food served past midnight!" Pros: "Fortunately plane not full and was able to use adjacent seat(s)." Cons: "Let me change my ticket due to a death in the family." Pros: "The seat is comfortable." Cons: "One toilet got dirty, and I had to wait for another toilet. One option of the food was no longer available." Pros: "Preference given for those requiring extra help boarding" Cons: "Very narrow seats with very very limited leg room. I’m only 5’4” tall and had no leg room. My sister is 5’11” and had leg cramps from the 4.5 hour flight because of the lack of leg room. Probably time to replace this plane." Pros: "Singapore Airlines has everything worked out for you before you land. That's a great help. The stewardesses were just phenomenal and endlessly polite. I will definitely use them again." Cons: "As much as I normally nitpick something, I literally have no criticism at all of Singapore Airlines. Everything they did was a step above everyone else." Pros: "Crew was super nice and the food was good (for plane food)! Really appreciated that they had snacks and chocolate on hand for hungry passengers throughout the flight. A 17 hour plane ride is never the best, but Singapore Air made it as pleasant as possible. Also, we booked on Kayak and was routed through a third party vendor JustFly, which I was a little worried about - but our booking went off without a hitch." Cons: "Flight was a little warm but was able to get it cooler via help from crew but got warmer again towards the end of flight. Overall good flight though" Pros: "Excellent crew and very well dressed and always smiling" Cons: "The lights were switched off for a very long time. That can be avoided" Pros: "The crew was really nice. The plane was clean and comfortable." Cons: "The lunch part at the end was a little late we had just had a snack and a small sandwich so we didn't eat a lot. But food was great!" Pros: "Flight was full but crew was attentive and very pleasant. Star Alliance Lounge at LAX had a good variety of food and drinks - Asian, western, small bites, snacks; red, white, bubbly and even a bartender who'll mix up cocktails. I love flying SQ." Cons: "For a premium economy service, it was really good." Pros: "The crew did a wonderful job of anticipating needs and having all the little ammenities you could want." Cons: "They gave you a menu at the start of the flight but didn't serve any of that food, and the food wasn't very good" Pros: "Despite being a very late flight at 11 pm, the crew was courteous but not over the top, when all the passengers wanted to catch some sleep" Cons: "Lufthansa's short haul slim line seats become uncomfortable after 1.5 hours" Pros: "Handset to control screen didn’t work. Airline reimbursed me with $75 voucher for inflight duty-free shop." Cons: "The planes are pretty outdated especially the connecting flights from Narita to HKG" Pros: "Excellent service from the cabin crew." Cons: "The Japanese (Washoku) breakfast was not as good as I expected." Pros: "The crew was amazing. They were all very nice to us." Pros: "The crew was great, friendly and helpful. The food was good and the overall service on the plane was great." Cons: "Our flight was delayed from Los Angeles and we did not make our connecting flight in Tokyo. The next option they had was a full 24 hours later so we ended up taking the train. I tried to make adjustments to one of my flights for the return home and was told that is not an option." Pros: "They were very helpful in changing my seat to an aisle seat. The first meal was rather mediocre. The second one was good. The seats were spacious and comfortable and I did not feel claustrophobic." Cons: "They were very helpful in changing my seat to an aisle seat. The first meal was rather mediocre. The second one was good. The seats were spacious and comfortable and I did not feel claustrophobic." Pros: "The crew" Cons: "The seats were substantially more cramped than the other flight." Pros: "Crew was amazing and very comfortable seat" Cons: "Food can be better and Entertainment was poor There should be more choices available. WiFi was spotty only 150 MB was available after paying. It should be free in business class like other airlines" Pros: "Polite, attentive, and amiable staff show they take pride in their top notch service. Entertainment options (movies, documentaries, travel guides) on screen are also a huge plus." Cons: "Seats are way too small, incredibly uncomfortable to the point of painful ness. More luggage space" Cons: "Fellow passenger didn't stay in his space , would prefer flight attendant to inform kindly" STARLUX Airlines9.2 Japan Airlines8.7 Korean Air8.7 Singapore Airlines8.6 ANA8.6 Book Cheap Manila Plane Tickets Recent one-way flight deals Only flying one-way?
