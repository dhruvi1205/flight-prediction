Great legroom, good food, and a terrific cabin crew who was helpful and kind." Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "The seat, the food, the services, the boarding could have been better!" Pros: "Wouldn’t allow me to board with no explanation and the third party company Flyus.com is a complete rip off" Cons: "Use better companies to book your tickets" Pros: "The crew, as always, was super professional, friendly, helpful, and efficient. The plane was neat and clean, I was pleasantly surprised with personal items like tooth paste, tooth brush, and slippers. And I was thrilled that you served wine with food as well. That goes a long way!" Cons: "I didn’t rate comfort and food as “excellent” as I did other items not because they were not great, but flying on an economy class for 14.5 hours, I can’t force myself to speak too highly about these two items, which doesn’t necessarily reflect my flight experience or Korean Air quality!" Pros: "The music of kpop" Cons: "Would have been good if there’s more korean drama available on the trip and some kimbap food too" Pros: "Flight attendants were the friendliest and most patient I have ever experienced. Great customer service!!!" Cons: "Seats of any airplane could use improvement on comfort. But comfort was good." Pros: "The crew was great. The technology is great. I enjoyed the movies." Cons: "I wish I had more water." Cons: "During 14 hour flight, meals were served at the beginning and at the end which comes to 10 hours in between. Between the two meals, they offered a snack of banana or brownie. My wife and I were starving. Terrible!" Pros: "Great customer service. Flight attendants showed passengers a lot of attention. Well done." Cons: "The plane was way too hot! Being trapped in a stuffy plane for 5 hours and sweating was the worst!" The flight was canceled due to a mechanical problem.

Cons: "Everything was great." Pros: "New plane or so it seemed. Crew very attentive to needs. Nice entertainment system with large screen." Pros: "The cabin crews were excellent. Food was delicious. Lots of leg room in Economy class. Overall had a great experience" Cons: "none" Pros: "The staff of ANA are so friendly and accommodating. When checking in, the woman at the counter moved me to a window seat from the middle, free of charge. They were very patient and helpful." Cons: "The food was a little strange, I had salmon and rice as “breakfast” with iceberg lettuce side salad. The pieces of salmon were little shreds with a funky taste. Not bad, but not what I wanted on a long red eye flight. Also I wish there’d been more Hollywood movie selections." Pros: "The flight was late checking in. The staff handled the situation well and kept the passengers informed." Pros: "Crew was fantastic. Really polite and attentive. Liked that they offered liquids throughout the flight to keep us hydrated. Good experience overall." Cons: "Entertainment - didn't have to many movies I liked. Food was just ok.

Other than that, everything was amazing" Pros: "Food and services were great" Cons: "There were not a lot of selections on the TV." Pros: "Service and the fact that flight was not full provided for a better experience. Staff was super friendly and attentive. The films were new and tv was big! Food was ok." Airport lounge for business class is too crowded and not comfortable. Poor foods and facilities. Boarding was delayed. A lot of coughing people in the flight even in the business class, which indicated poor screening and health risks. Cons: "Rather long wait at business check-in, friendliness there ok, on board service slow with the champagne, old aircraft with old configuration of seats, nothing really bad, but it's not like this that you win an airline of the year award!"

New plane amazing food on a two hour flight Great new entertainment system on the seat back." Cons: "A little more leg room." Pros: "Singapore Airlines delivers as always.

Gave socks and toothbrush amenities, along with the normal pillow and blanket." Cons: "It felt a tad bit hot in the plane. No personal vents to adjust to one's own desire." Pros: "The service was excellent start to finish. I found the movie selection to be excellent on the plane and the food was tasty and above average for airline food, and the seats were comfortable." Cons: "First experience with Singapore where the crew made a negative impression. As soon as the plane pulled away from the terminal, crew members seemed rushed and frantic, literally running back and forth from Economy Premium to the galley gathering items. Approximately every 7-10 minutes, crew members would be running back and forth next to my seat with heavy foot steps, which would wake me up. I also noticed that certain crew members were shouting at passengers to get their attention instead of lowering themselves to be heard. One flight attendant almost spilled orange juice on me because she turned around too fast trying to serve drinks. I'm not sure if they were short-staffed, or if it was the influence of a certain crew boss, but something was definitely wrong." Cons: "Flight attendants were bot friendly, appearwd to be botheted when askes questions or requests were made." Pros: "Great service and comfort." Cons: "Food was bland and breakfast availability was a joke. On any flight, passengers do not want spicy or evening meals, and having a limited amount number of breakfasts available was not amusing.

But we should have that choice as we are purchasing the ticket" Cons: "The boarding in lax" Pros: "Comfortable" Cons: "Need more comfortable headsets or ability to use personal earphones." Pros: "Comfort of the seats." Cons: "There should be more choices of food for people who do not eat Asian food." Pros: "Both the ground and aircrew were very helpful. I had a short transfer to another flight and was immediately greeted by a crew member that pointed me in the right direction. It was so relieving! There was also good entertainment and decent food on this flight." Cons: "I just wish there were vegetarian food options." Pros: "Really happy as had a exit seat so lots of leg room" Pros: "The crew and food was great. The legroom not so great." Pros: "Efficient boarding" Cons: "Seats extremely cramped especially when seat in front reclined. Will look for other airline on next trip due to this problem." Pros: "Boarding was delayed in Taipei although the flight made it in great time" Cons: "Website" Pros: "Clean plane" Cons: "Food was horrible, flight Attendants are professional but cold as ice." Cons: "No clothes to change. My fruits were expired because off the luggages not come to the destination." Cons: "Food is served in heated plastic containers.

Cons: "Biggest problem was late arrival, missing connection. Lateness caused by them at first, then a departing passenger caused further delay. But they were late to begin with. Next problem was their REFUSAL to give me an aisle seat. I reserved an aisle seat originally, aisle seats were available when I tried to change, but agent REFUSED to accommodate me with either aisle or window. Sat in middle with huge guy next to me. Very uncomfortable. Food was mediocre on this leg. Oh, and late departing AGAIN. Will seriously look for other options on next trip." Pros: "Plane was clean and modern. Staff was very courteous. An overall pleasant flight." Pros: "Fantastic flight...Qatar’s QSuites are fantastic, very comfortable, Amazon my service from the crew, fantastic entertainment options, and with the privacy of the suite ...very close to first class...in fact it is better than the first products (from a seat perspective) of many other airlines such as United, Delta, Virgin, BA, etc." Cons: "I wish there were more vegetarian options on the menu" Pros: "Individual service, happy and natural looking crew, comfort and company aim."
