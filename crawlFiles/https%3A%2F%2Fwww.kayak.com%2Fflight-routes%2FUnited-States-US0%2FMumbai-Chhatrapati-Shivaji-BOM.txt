Really appreciated that they had snacks and chocolate on hand for hungry passengers throughout the flight. A 17 hour plane ride is never the best, but Singapore Air made it as pleasant as possible. Also, we booked on Kayak and was routed through a third party vendor JustFly, which I was a little worried about - but our booking went off without a hitch."Read more about Singapore Airlines Pros: "Crew was super nice and the food was good (for plane food)!

Also, we booked on Kayak and was routed through a third party vendor JustFly, which I was a little worried about - but our booking went off without a hitch." Pros: "Excellent crew and very well dressed and always smiling" Cons: "The lights were switched off for a very long time. That can be avoided" Pros: "The crew did a wonderful job of anticipating needs and having all the little ammenities you could want." Cons: "They gave you a menu at the start of the flight but didn't serve any of that food, and the food wasn't very good" Pros: "Handset to control screen didn’t work. Airline reimbursed me with $75 voucher for inflight duty-free shop." Cons: "Aircrew took my carry on away while I was waiting to board saying it was too large; left me without the essential items I wanted during the 19.5 hours in the air and two plane changes. Other people were allowed to keep carry ons bigger than mine so I don't understand why they did this." Pros: "The plane was new. The in flight entertainment system was good, although I never got to experience it fully because the Flight attendant kept switching it off, as I had paid extra (an arm and a leg) for a “bulkhead seat”" Cons: "The service was beyond awful! The Flight Attendants had a “could care less” attitude. I had special ordered a meal, and they gave me the wrong one. I did not want to make a big deal, so I just ate it. Then they did not offer any beverages when the meal came! I literally had to beg them to make me their famous “Singapore sling”. Shocking really!!. When I had my coffee, my request for cream and sugar went ignored THREE times. Finally they grudgingly gave me only cream, rendering my coffee undrinkable. .....And the list goes on. Never ever will I travel on this horrid airline again!" Pros: "Satisfied and feel good on Singapore airlines, definitely will consider next trip" Pros: "We loved the service, quality of food, entertainment, and cleanliness of Singapore Airlines flight!" Cons: "Economy is still tightly packed with limited leg room considering the distance traveled." Pros: "Very good service" Cons: "Very poor entertainment. Upgrade options at the transfer desk not very clear and the staff present there not courteous" Cons: "In spite of ordering vegetarian food, was offered a non-vegetarian option and was told that is Asian vegetarian. Food quality was bad too." Pros: "Flight is online" Cons: "Flight Attendants performed acceptable. They pushed the table cart and hit me twice without apologizing." Pros: "Crew was very accommodating!" Cons: "Just being in the plane in general. Sitting for 12 hours is really uncomfortable" Cons: "Service could be better. One flight attendant was sick but still working." Pros: "Service and boarding were very nice and smooth. Food and entertainment were excellent." Pros: "Seat is reasonably comfortable in Eco Plus" Cons: "Flight departed 30 minutes late, gate in SFO was a mad house with no practical lounge options for *G (must use UA Club in T3 which is a 10-15 minute walk). Please also give more than a thimble of water / beverages - serving sizes are tiny compared to US airlines." Pros: "Clean and efficient. Catered to our needs. Definitely would travel them again." Pros: "Food was great and the crews were helpful. They do offer snacks/drinks in between meals. For those who do not know, they do offer wine as a drink in the Economy class (usually red wine)." Cons: "Speakers are not good during announcement. I can barely hear it. if they can improve that, that will be great." Pros: "I enjoyed the movies, the food was good, and services" Pros: "The flight attendants were on point and very well trained. Decent legroom in Economy class and decent inflight entertainment. Flight on tune and boarding was seamless. Will fly EVA air again." Cons: "Food was decent but could have been better. Entertainment was ok but could have used more choices. Not much too gripe about though." Pros: "Flight comfortable but would have liked more water throughout flight" Cons: "Service speed" Pros: "I had to pay two tickets for same flight from Islamabad to San Francisco and going from San Francisco to Islamabad it’s been cancel and I am fighting for my money back they don’t want to refund it" Pros: "Plane was modern and more comfortable than most" Cons: "I do understand that it was an overnight flight but the crew came around only during meals and at no other time did they check on us. I hit the call button and nobody came - call button just went off. I was in the middle next to a sleeping passenger and could not get up." Pros: "The seats were spacious and comfortable. Ample room for the long flight." Cons: "Desert option: warm cookies" Cons: "In most cases i was so disappointed to be allowed only 1 lugage of 50lb while i was supposed to be allowed 2 50lb of bags,i had to pay 275$ for the extra luggage,very disappointed as i was not expect that to happen,you guys made me look ashamed infront of people as i had to borrow money to pay for" Cons: "They ran out of non-vegetarian meals, which is not acceptable. The seats were rather narrow" Pros: "The crew was great and the dinner was really good!" Cons: "Breakfast could have been better and the seat was pretty uncomfortable" Pros: "Emirates itself was great but using fly Dubai from Dubai to Kabul was awful." Cons: "No flights to Kabul using Fly Dubai when someone books tickets actually for Emirates." Pros: "The crew was fantastic. The food was good for airline food." Cons: "The seats were narrow and seemed a bit smaller than usual." Cons: "They delayed the flight over entertainment system and that caused me to miss my connection" Pros: "They were very courteous and provided us with a solution with an overweight luggage so that we wouldn’t pay the extra fees. Flight was very smooth on the 777. Best flight ever." Cons: "Nothing negative about this flight." We were stranded in bus for 10 min waiting for baording..Specially when you are traveling with kids and long previous flight. Flight has no information regarding time to destination. Wish to have screen for international travels. Pros: "The crew was amazing. Food was great. Clean bathrooms. Great entertainment." Cons: "We had our passports and boarding passes checked five times in the course of 2 minutes by five different people one after the next. My cabin luggage was searched right before boarding. I appreciate the need for security, but that was excessive and unnecessary. In the peak of the Corona virus craze, the security made all passengers take off shoes and walk without any protection. This is not Qatar Airways doing - New York JFK security B S, but I am sure airways companies have some say to change it." Pros: "Crew did a great job keeping the long 11hour flight manageable!" Cons: "Food is served in heated plastic containers. I would request Qatar airways not heat the food in the plastic container." Pros: "The crew was amazing" Cons: "The tv didn’t work throughout the whole flight. Very uncomfortable seats" Pros: "The crew provide good service but personally i did not like the food that could be lot better." Pros: "Excellent service on both flights. Truly a 5 star experience. Well done Qatar Airways." Cons: "Nothing. Keep up the good work" Cons: "Extraordinarily care taken On board. Very impressed with Qutar Airways. Excellent" Pros: "Staff are very polite and helpful (ground staff and in the air)." Cons: "The food was hit and miss. Some of it was good and some of it used ketchup as a sauce. The economy seats have been stripped down to budget airline level padding and the rows seem have been been jammed in a little closer." Pros: "Yes overall probably the best flight to Chennai from DC" Not exceptional but all good. Business class seats are like the domestic Mint class on Jet Blue. Comfortable but not exceptional. Food is good but not superb. Flight attendants were better on India leg than Miami to Zurich. All India staff was more professional and service oriented. Very polite and service with a smile. Crew took my carry on and checked it in; turned out to be a blessing; however the luggage was delayed at my final destination; receiving it 36 hours later. Thought, we'd get, at least water; but the Swiss chocolate was delicious. Thanks. Pros: "Amazing - they had a full dinner for a 9:55pm flight, with real silverware, complementary alcohol, for economy passengers! Crew extremely professional and efficient." Pros: "Food was good ." Cons: "Didnt turn on the AC until were in air, implying that everybody was sweating for 30min from boarding to ip in air. Crew refused Green Tea, saying it is only offered in Business class" Pros: "I did not receive a single email from kayak letting me know I could check in or select seats. No updates on flight status! Poor service!" Cons: "Email updates before flight! Not a single email sent!!" Pros: "Crew was very nice and attentive" Cons: "Leg room on my first flight (longest leg of the trip) was not much and when the person in front of me leaned their chair back, my knees were touching the chair." Pros: "the CREW WAS FRIENDLY AND CELEBRATING EASTER WITH THE GUESTS" Cons: "THE FOOD WAS ADEQUATE, GIVEN THAT WE WERE ON AN AIRPLANE" Pros: "The crew was great! The entertainment was pretty good too." Cons: "The cabin was WAY too warm." Pros: "Food was good. Crew was kind and gracious." Cons: "Seats were extremely cramped. Once the person in the front reclined their seat it was very difficult to get out of the seat. Also better guidance is needed during boarding. Finally, my hand carry was checked 4 times by 4 different people, which means your staff doesn’t trust their own colleagues." Pros: "Check in agent was extremely helpful in expediting both me and my bags after a late check-in. Flight attendants very friendly and helpful, food excellent.
