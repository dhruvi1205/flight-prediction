Excellent crew, excellent food, excellent aircraft, and excellent leg room. No recommendations." Pros: "Economy was surprisingly comfortable. Boarding and deplaning were very quick." Cons: "Not a ton of movies to choose from. Enough, but less than most domestic US flights." Pros: "I like how the crew made rounds hourly to provide drinks and ensure we are good! Also appreciated when they were able to accommodate last minute meal changes!!" Pros: "The entertainment system, the leg room, the toilets with complimentary tooth brushes. JAL hit it out of the park." Cons: "Not one thing." Pros: "The cabin crew was excellent -- friendly, always helpful, energetic." Cons: "We requested a seafood special meal. The food quality was satisfactory, but most of the items tasted very bland. The accompanying dishes were unimaginative -- raw vegetables (salad), steamed vegetables, pickled vegetables. One exeption was a smoked salmon bit with capers -- this was the tastiest part among 8 meals over 4 flights." Cons: "Very good airline except for the fact that the staff at Narita airport." Pros: "Soo Much Food! Crew was very polite and helpful." Cons: "They didn’t offer a vegetarian meal option in flight, but there was enough sides that it didn’t really matter." Pros: "Food was great" Cons: "It’s 14h flight. I wanted more water. I had to keep asking but the size was too small... I didn’t want orange or apple juice...." Pros: "I was randomly upgraded for the first 10 hours of my trip to Premium economy and it was amazing. Two big hot meals served throughout the flight and plenty of drink service. lots of leg room and could recline comfortably. Flight attendants were wonderful and very helpful. Lots of new movies to watch and games to keep you entertained." Cons: "Flew economy for the 2nd part of my trip and the seat was very hard and was impossible to get comfy. Same meal service as premium economy and was once again delicious. Much colder on this flight and the thin blankets do very little to help." Pros: "JAL is on time with good cabin crew. Food is good and enough. In-flight entertainment - 4 movies form San Diego to Narita. 3 Movies form Narita to San Diego (tail winds make the return trip shorter). I love and appreciate the toothbrush/paste in the bathroom. After a long flight, nobody wants to talk to me face to face haha" Pros: "Food and crew was good" Cons: "An adults only section would be great as there were a lot of screaming children on board, also seats were a bit on the small side" Pros: "Food is amazing, planes are good." Cons: "The boarding crew at the gate did not say anything while weighing the carry on bag. I was ask to go to another person who issued me check in baggage sticker and told me to hand over your baggage to a person inside. At last he mentioned to not put any valuables in that bag. My carry on bag was just 1lb extra and the first person could have told me right away and I would have thrown away chocolates and brought down the weight to permissible limit. In general passenger do carry valuable stuff in carry on bag. I had to follow whatever I was told." Pros: "Crew and flight comfort were fine until the flight got canceled after sitting on the plane for over an hour" Cons: "Wasn’t happy with the accommodation after the flight cancellation, was told no other flights for 3 days so I ended up paying $250 more to get on a different airline that day to make the wedding I was going for." Pros: "For an economy seat, was very comfortable!! Love the food." Pros: "Overall a decent flight." Cons: "Didn’t like the boarding experience. You have somebody look at the boarding pass but then they sent us to a waiting area. The waiting/boarding area didn’t have space to make nice lines fir boarding so it was pretty haphazardly organized. You really can do better." Pros: "Cleaningness" Cons: "Main problems at Dubai airport. Employee at the airport charged me money for the same luggage that Newark employees said it is according to air line rules.

Overnight didn’t work from Bos to Doha and had to eat food without light This flight was packed and undercrewd! Service cart cam by twice on a 14 hour flight Good and comfortable flight Helpful crew Decent food and drinks Was humiliated at Doha airport, treaded like a cattle class traveler, I hold platinum pro status with AA and I don’t fly economy even domestic but was made to travel in the middle seat in economy class and boarding zone 3 and was denied lounge access at Doha airport. Never was humiliated like this before. We encountered a glitch when we tried to board the flight because our boarding passes had been printed by Qatar Airways in Jakarta.

Seat cushions are hard and thin. movie selections are terrible and few. worst selection ever." Pros: "The whole travel experience on Asiana is great from easy check in to great onboard crew, food and service." Cons: "Nothing" Pros: "(Business class) Friendly, helpful crew.

Pros: "Best flight I’ve ever been on!" Cons: "It had just snowed 20” in Seattle, so we had a short delay." Pros: "I'll give a more complete and less-biased review if I get it back!" Cons: "one check-in crew (female) at gate was not very nice. My mom is disabled & in her personal wheelchair. The other check-in crew members told us (5 total) to go together to board the plane then this female staff told us we can only have one family member go in with my mom (to take care of the wheelchair then assist her on the plane) next time we board the plane. Their messages are inconsistent & her attitude was uncalled for, especially when she let other disabled passengers on with their more than one family members & the other Asiana staff members told us to go in at the same time." Pros: "The crew was great and the ammentities made me feel comfortable" Pros: "We liked the service and food and had plenty of space since the flight was half empty." Cons: "Flight was 50 minutes late leaving Seattle because Asiana was waiting for a connecting flight. We still made our connection in Seoul so no problem." Pros: "The crew is great. Seats are more comfortable than other airlines. They feed you lots of food. They are my favorite airline." Cons: "Some planes don't have the foot rest. It makes a huge difference in comfort." Pros: "Not much. Plane was almost on time." Cons: "Disgusting food, old plane with terrible seatback screens as well as movie selection." i saved my points for more than 10 years in anticipation of treating myself to an upper class fight to and from london on virgin atlantic. i was shocked to find what you consider “upper class” on the dreamliner. it was, at best, a mediocre business class accommodation. it was tight and not that comfortable, with nearly no personal storage. everything was cramped and just generally disappointing. once i lucked into a 1st class upgrade to europe on lufthansa - a magical experience that found me reluctant to sleep, lest i deprive myself the joy of their setup. i expected something similar from virgin atlantic, but i could not have been more wrong. it will be the same arrangement on my flight home, but at least i know what (not) to expect. to be clear, this is only in reaction to the physical accommodations. your people were, and always are fantastic. Pros: "People were friendly. Flight was comfortable." Cons: "Staff incorrectly assessed documents needed for visas, and told us we were incomplete and needed to return home. Instead of looking up policy, we were denied boarding mid-flight, missed a wedding, and had to spend three days in London instead of our destination. Also, we got bug bites during the flight that turned out to be from bed bugs, which followed us home and caused much frustration for months." Cons: "Food wasn’t great and not a lot of it. London to Orlando was good. Connection was good." Cons: "Information on when we can check in on upcoming flights. Other airlines we have booked for flights will email us 24 hours prior to departure. Virgin Atlantic did not. I had to call and I was directed to their web site and was able to check in on line. Thanks" Pros: "Karl was amazing! So helpful and sweet!" Cons: "Having the crew tell the guy behind me to plug in his ear phones to watch the video in his phone, rather than me after 20 minutes of noise." Pros: "The crew where awesome and catered to every need and requirement." Cons: "need to have a slightly deeper seat pitch in premium economy to allow people out without having to wake each other up. Especially on night flights." Cons: "I cancelled this flight online, then I called to let them know I was getting emails, but that I had cancelled. For two days I received emails about delayed flights and now this." Pros: "Meals were excellent and plane was very clean. Economy delight is definitely an upgrade worth considering with extra leg room and space in front of you in general." Cons: "Boarding can get crowded so don't be in a rush" Pros: "Nobody are better hosts than the British. Great service, lovely people." Pros: "Crew was very nice. Food was very good and plentiful. Entertainment was good. Overall the very long flight was better than expected." Cons: "It took forever to board in Sydney with all passengers standing and waiting for 45 minutes and never being told what was going on. I resented having my passport and ticket demanded at least 4 times. A bit overkill and a power trip by security. Absolutely despise airport security...there is no uniformity."
