Cons: "There was an almost 4 hour delay that WestJet is taking no responsibility for, and their online chat agents lack any compassion or understanding. Also received an email saying the aircraft changed and there would be a seatback flight entertainment system but there wasn't." Pros: "Crew were nice, everything was on time." Cons: "Need to use your own device to watch entertainment. No screens." Pros: "Roomie seat. Professional curdious crew. Fast smooth flight. Westjet connect access for entertainment." Pros: "Good crew and on time departure" Cons: "Overnight flight. How nice it would have been to have blanket and pillows as provided by some airlines ." Pros: "staff did the best they could to assist" Cons: "Flight change, would have like more options to reschedule flights. However good service from overall." Pros: "Left early and arrived early" Cons: "Cabin was way too warm. Also not as much space on 737-700 as 737-800" Pros: "The staff on board made us completely forget we just experienced a terrible 6 hour experience in the hands of westjet from punta cana. The airport staff and security were efficient and all friendly. Helped us every step of the way. But again, a big thank you to the 4 flight attendants on the ws 254 to Halifax. Made our crappy day much better simply by being a friendly and happy face." Cons: "Didnt like having to connect but understand that was to my own booking." Cons: "My returning flights were not correct. I ended up having 2 returning flights back to Halifax which made me have to overnight in Toronto unexpectedly." Pros: "I liked the price for my flight however I booked using my AirMiles." Cons: "I have travel with WestJet many times is the past and had nothing but good to say. This was my first time using WestJet Encore and was totally shocked and disappointed. The flight crew i found to be very rude with and had an attitude. The biggest shock was the greetings and all announcements were in English accept the safety rules where the pre-recorded tape was played. If asked about the return flight from Halifax to Montreal, one word to describe it "disaster". I was totally turned off with WestJet. I will for sure continue using Porter as I was always pleased with there service. As they say "you get what you pay for"." Can't be happy with a 5 hour delay. Only given $10 voucher for food and still EVERYTHING was an upcharge during the flight. TThe first time I have ever flown with flare and both ways sucked There was no entertainment There was no food or beverage service , not even a glass of water The plane door could not be opened upon arrival I try to buy water the cabin crews told me I had to wait for them to come around with the trolley I waited over 2 hours !!!!! Literally 2 hours I was so thirsty . Lots of leg room in the front rows. Wish water was free. I don't like anything. The crew was so bad. Misbehaved badly. The worst flight. Long wait for baggage check in with only one on site attendant. The worst airlines I have seen in my life they don’t respect anyone they don’t care about anyone they lost our luggage and no one is responding. We waited for five hours to get our luggage back.🤬🤬🤬👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 Great staff. Cramped seating for someone 5 feet, 2 inches and average weight. So if you're tall or heavy -- good luck. Even if you wait until the 24 hour checkin time, you still charge for seating. Really? So either it is a less-than-pleasant experience or pay the price of a "big name" airline. And if I'm going to pay their prices, why would I fly in your cramped seat? So, in the end, you want to give less comfort for the same prices as Air Canada. Go figure.
