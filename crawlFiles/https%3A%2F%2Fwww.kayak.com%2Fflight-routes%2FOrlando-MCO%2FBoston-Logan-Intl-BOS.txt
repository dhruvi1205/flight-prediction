Cons: "Why should I have to buy food and headphones when I bought a ticket through Icelandair that was Business Class?" Cons: "Our flight was delayed 4 times. We then sat on the runway for an extra 45 minutes because someone’s tv did not work. We missed our set transportation which was already rescheduled 4 times and had to pay $150 Uber to get home" Cons: "They had to reset entertainment sets 3 times before they started working.

Pros: "Nice plane, good service and pilots, great landing - no issues at all." Cons: "Flight attendant in First class was visibly frustrated and unfriendly.

Pros: "individual TVs" Cons: "it would be great if you could not use all those one-use plastic cups. waste is a real issue in the US and the solution is using re-usable items like washable cups. Unboarding was a nightmare and it started to get really hot waiting to get off." Cons: "Flight was 1,5 hr delayed, which almost caused me to miss my connecting flight" Pros: "Flight itself was fine. Captain was very communicative about rough air. 757-300's are amazingling noisy; recommend headphones for a relaxing flight." Cons: "Could not login to Delta app at MCO to show boarding pass. Had to return to a kiosk to print paper passes. Very aggravating but lesson learned to always have a paper backup. Boarding was disorganized and not by priority. Gate agents allowed passengers bull rush the gate and allowed line cuts. They lost control." Cons: "Wheelchair shortage on arrival, although I had one reserved. Waited for a while then walked. Not ideal. Very long wait for bus to rental car center." Cons: "We thought we were flying AirFrance as our emails came from them and were surprised to learn after waiting in the AirFrance baggage drop queue for 30 mins that we were in the wrong place."

Watched two movies. Flight was on time and painless" Cons: "Only complimentary snack was pretzels and only a cup of water." Cons: "We flew from Rome to JFK and arrived at 12:40 pm only to find out that our 3:30 pm flight had been cancelled a long time ago. No one had notified us of our new booking on a 9:10 flight to Boston. No one at American or British Airways could provide us with an earlier departure or compensate us to take alternative transportation. Our 9:10 flight was then delayed until 10:50 pm. We arrived in Boston at 12:02 am, 11 1/2 hours after our arrival at JFK from Rome. This was not a very friendly welcome home. We never would have booked such an extended delay as we only live 4 hours from New York City." Pros: "One was great and one was not helpful and was condescending" Pros: "Staff was polite and friendly. It was a great experience!" Cons: "not enough space for legs, no food, flight attendants not especially nice, a long delay, ..." Cons: "The check in process took to long. In line more than an hour." Cons: "We were downgraded from Main Cabin Extra rows 7 and 8 to row 30. We were told that we will get refund automatically. However, we received nothing. Getting a refund back is now becomes a very complicated process with zero transparency. Main Cabin Extra is kind of a scam. We bought it specifically for an extra leg room. However, on the flight from PHX to BOS, all seats in the economy class have the same leg room. The agent explicitly told us that on this plane all seats are the same. So, they offer product they do not have and collect money. Sounds like a scam to me." Pros: "the crew handled the lengthy delay as well as they could, seems like they didn't have any information either which is ridiculous." Cons: "We boarded the plane at 1:30 for a 2:00 flight, there was a filter out in one of the three bathrooms; the option to take a 45 min flight without use of the restrooms was there, we were told to use the restroom if we needed to before the flight so everyone did... then we continued to sit on the ground for two hours. After two hours we were allowed to get off the plane, 20 minutes later back onto the plane, backed away from the gate and then pulled into a different gate and were told to get back off the plane. At this point we were given no info or direction but to go talk to special services if we want to re-book a different flight (sold out until at the earliest 8:15pm). After about an hour they announce they are re-boarding the original plane, takes another 45 minutes to board the plane, then we are told two separate issues caused this lengthy delay one was a filter in the bathroom and the other was a thermostat... seems like very basic standard maintenance issues that could have been avoided with routine checks. We were offered zero compensation, the trip took over 6 hours in all to fly from Philadelphia PA to Boston MA; a trip I could have driven in less time. I continue to have issues with American Airlines and "mechanical" delays, the last flight i was on From Charlotte to Baltimore was delayed an hour due to a strap in the cargo area. I don't understand the logic behind the decisions made to hold the full plane over 5 hours instead of taking a 45 minute flight, but I will say the crew was very apologetic and handled the situation well." Pros: "The actual attendants on board were perfunctory but had zero urgency or understanding that we had been delayed or notified we'd be so delayed. Appeared there was zero communcation between the gate staff and actual crew. So much was so 'typical Miami' which is just a sad way any travel experience should be described. I expect more from the largest global airline especially when I just listened to several interviews from the CEO who appeared to pride himself to be accurate in being the best to serve his patrons." Pros: "Great, friendly crew and excellent customer service from flight attendants." Pros: "Seats were pretty comfortable" Cons: "In-flight entertainment depended on the Wi-Fi working. It did not work the whole flight." Pros: "The plane was nice and in good shape. They had beverage service for a very quick flight which is nice. Can't rate food or entertainment because only hour or so flight." Cons: "It was freezing in the plane and I'm never cold. When I asked for a blanket they had none!!! They had just announced whatever they can do to make your flight more comfortable ask them. Not true, just words. Disappointed after the great treatment after flying ANA." Cons: "Flight was cancelled on our way back home from Gudalajara, was speaking to a representative for almost 2 hours to get me on the next flight the flight representative forgot to put me on hold and told everyone how rude i was, i was not rude i was just trying to get home. The representative couldn’t help me so i asked to be transferred to a manager, after 2 hours i was transferred and the manager hung the phone up. Long story short i called back spoke to another manager Yana and she was the rudest lady ever! She basically told me for waiting to long i will have to be placed on a flight 2 days after my cancellation flight. I started to cry because i needed to be home and she basically did not care so i took the date. Never again and i will warn everyone about this airline and their customer service!" Pros: "Direct flight on time. The gate person help us with seat assignments." Cons: "All the charges." Cons: "Because of missed connection I had to go from Dulles to Reagan airport" Pros: "The crew was excellent - courteous/aware/friendly. The flight, although 2 hours delayed (9;20pm scheduled departure) was pleasant and smooth. Also, the de-boarding process was surprisingly quick." Cons: "A 2 hour delay at 9:20pm at night is unfortunate yet frustrating experience, especially when we moved our flight up due to a travel warning for EWR (ironically enough, our originally scheduled flight (1922 MCO-EWR). I'm giving an overall OK (instead of good) due to the fact that there were no snacks (although I did not want anything, it didn't go unnoticed) and although there was free inflight entertainment for personal devices, I feel the passengers should have been given free internet access - in my opinion, it would have been the appropriate thing to do. In any case, this experience doesn't change my positive opinion of United." Pros: "Free TV since we were 2 hours delayed" Cons: "4 delays in 1 day on 2 flights. 2 gate changes with no relay of info and to top it all off my wife and i were reassigned to separate seats at the last minute by the airline and very rudely told to deal with it and to calm down when I simply asked why. We were appalled and embarrassed in front of many others in the gate boarding area. The gate agent in Houston has no place in customer service and was on some kind of a power trip. This surprised me with recent events. We are done with United now for many reasons" Cons: "The flight was very warm, I paid $300 for a one way and was assigned a seat in the very last row that did not recline next to bathroom which was smelly. The air just wasn't fresh and made it difficult to rest l. No entertainment provided" Cons: "I will never fly with United again because the practice of overbooking a flight jeopardized my trip to see my daughter. It is clearly a business decision and United makes more money that way; but at what cost? If I pay for a flight; at minimal, I expect to get to my destination. Service, comfort, entertainment and all other categories rank a distant second to getting to one's destination.
