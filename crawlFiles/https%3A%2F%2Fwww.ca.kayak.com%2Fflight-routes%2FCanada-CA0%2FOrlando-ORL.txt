Seating for premium class could be COMFORTABLE." Cons: "cleaner plane would be nicer. quieter plane would be nicer. Seating for premium class could be COMFORTABLE." Pros: "Yes to both, will repeat trip...." Cons: "Wider isle....I have broad shoulders and I got frequently bumped by other passengers and crew. Maybe sit in middle seat..." Pros: "Crew was fine. I’ll never rate meals you have to pay for, at double or triple store prices, very high." Pros: "The flight delayed but the crew was really helping! Huge thank to the lady served in the economy class AS2239 on March 4th from Vancouver to Seattle. I was not able to catch the next flight without her helping." Pros: "Every thing was awesome It was the best airlines I had experience since I came here" Cons: "Nothing" Pros: "Crew was very friendly, funny, and respectful." Cons: "Couldn’t figure out how to get free entertainment, did not seem to be an option." Pros: "Very nice gate attendants!! And on flight staff were great!" Pros: "TSA pre-cleared me so I didn't even have to take off my shoes and there wad no one else in line in front of me. Alaska Airlines has comfortable seats with lots of leg room. We didn't get fed but there were many choices of movies and t.v. shows to watch." Pros: "Comfortable seats" Cons: "Delayed, may of been beyond the pilots control. Scrambled seating arrangements." I loved the crew's professionalism. The landing was unbelievably smooth, haven't experienced that in years Their system was slow so it took them well over 4 hours to complete checkin but they kept assuring us that the flight won’t leave without all the passengers as it’s their fault but at the end of 4th hour then tell us that the immigration will close for the night and the last few of us are left stranded behind. The customer service itnay open at night. The airlines does have its own crew at Toronto airport so no one to help us. Cons: "Can’t be that I’ll pay a full price for the flight and get a seat that will not decline back. Especially if I’m longer than 6 ft. It was a horrible flight with a crew that didn’t want to do anything to help except from saying “it is what it is”" Pros: "We got upgraded to business class due to getting bumped from flight." Cons: "We got bumped from our flight and split up so my wife and child had to go to Rosario on their own, and my other son and I had to take a separate flight via Buenos Aires, causing our prearranged driver to wait for many hours and significant delay and stress. Our short time in Rosario was cut shorter" Pros: "I like the 2 2 seating" Cons: "Having to go to other counter to pay bag fees after check in is annoying. I get that with some fares you have to pay, but so much more efficient to swipe credit card at check in." Pros: "On time, clean, comfortable seats, free beverages, luggage arrived very quickly. An excellent flight." Pros: "The aircraft was very clean, well maintained. We were 20 min late in departing because the crew waited for a passenger with disabilities to make it to the plane. That was kind. Some of the lost time was made up and this flight had no connections out of the arrival airport that day, so not a major inconvenience. Short flight, so just drink service, no entertainment. Baggage arrived promptly. All good." Pros: "When my original flight schedule was interupted by one of the flights delay I was offered a very good alternative in a very kind manner." Cons: "The newly rescheduled flight had 2 and half hour delay" Pros: "The boarding process was fast. I appreciate being able to access SkyPriority boarding." Cons: "I wish my Delta SkyMiles status earned an upgrade to Business/First Class on this SkyMiles partner." Pros: "The crew inside the plane was ok" Cons: "The boarding was delayed and they didn't display the delay on the screens. When I asked the reason, 40 minutes after the displayed boarding time, they told me there was no delayed at all." Cons: "Seats were a little dirty especially for the COVID-19 going around." Pros: "Boarding process need to be improved. Seat assignment is horrible" Pros: "Security and checking in was quick and easy! Crew members were understanding and accommodating." Pros: "Horrible delay with unruly customers on the plane. But the flight attendants did great handling them" Cons: "When we booked this trip via Kayak, we thought that we were booking on Westjet. Westjet knew nothing about the flight when we tried to check in." Cons: "It could have left on time or they could have told us they weren’t leaving and let us get some sleep." Pros: "The flight attendants were amazing. 12 people had a connecting flight and they brought a shuttle bus. You dont see that kind of service any more 10 stars for that" Cons: "Super small plane." Pros: "The overall experience on the flight was quite pleasing. The flight crew created a warm atmosphere on what was a very cold morning. Seating was not the most comfortable but the wasn't unbearable." Cons: "Delta should have a better food menu for those early flights unless the motive is to encourage everyone to eat an organic and wholesome meal prior to boarding, something we all should be doing." Pros: "We eventually got to Atlanta." Cons: "Delta is flying a lot of commuter planes, which are pretty cramped. We usually fly first class, and the seating is essentially the same as what coach used to be. There's nothing "first class" about it. And of course, the flight was hours late." Pros: "Zee was our flight attendant and she was absolutely wonderful. Personable, attentive, and she made sure each and every person on the plane was comfortable and happy, going so far as to move solo passengers to empty rows so they could have more space. I wish she could be on every flight I take." Great flight, comfort, and staff. Prefer tv in back of seat but watching on phone will do Pros: "Friendly staff and the support they offered to my mother who needed a wheelchair." Cons: "I would have liked to have had WestJet internet and entertainment access. It was not offered on our flight from Toronto to Fredericton." Pros: "The fact that military personnel and retired military personnel and their spouse can check in luggage for free. The check in crew was also very courteous." Pros: "It ran on time. The pilot landed the plane without a big jolt. We could board and deplane using 2 exits." Cons: "Seat space" Pros: "Rotten stuff cancels out the good doesn't it. Be great if you could take some courses from Stephen Covey as you are missing some skills sets in hospitality. And stop being so cheap with the 3rd rate old old movies!" Cons: "I did not appreciate having the second row to the last on my 2nd plane coming back - I only had a turn around time of 20 minutes to catch my third Westjet flight. When we asked if the plane would wait for us - your crew just laughed in our faces." Pros: "Great, friendly crew in this scenic trip across to Victoria. Nice new aircraft operating this route." Pros: "Cheerfulness of WestJet employees." Cons: "Seat comfort; seats hard. Person next to me average size but still spilled into my seat with “man-spreading” and shoulders." Pros: "Efficient crew and reasonable seating" Cons: "Need more legroom or a device to fold passenger legs for the flight duration..." Pros: "Crew was good. Seats need to be updated and are confining. I appreciated being able to disembark through front and rear door." Cons: "More space between the seats." Pros: "the crew was very polite but the flight was too short to have a meal" Cons: "delayed embarking" Did not get to take it. Earlier flight was cancelled Pros: "Food" Cons: "There was loud, annoying static over the intercom off and on." Pros: "Crew very friendly" Cons: "Lufthansa continuosly treats repeat customers like milk cows. The new ‘light fare’ is a genius way to charge the same as before with ZERO customer support." Pros: "The crew did their best, but the seats were very uncomfortable;.The food was uneatable." Cons: "Everything." Pros: "The food was really good! I don’t expect much from airlines but I feel like I got a real meal on board (two of them!)" Cons: "We were delayed taking off and there were three screaming babies, but there’s only so much they can do about that." Pros: "The crew was polite and efficient. Moved very well around sleeping passengers sprawled feet. The shortcomings of the flight had to do with being in a tail section of an economy class in a packed transoceanic flight." Cons: "At the beginning of the long flight the cabin was chilled, which made me happy I had my hooded sweatshirt with me, but at the end it was hot and stuffy. There was no air regulation available from the seat, only light." Pros: "Staff was helpful and kind. Entertainment had variety." Cons: "Flight ran out of chicken meals fast, forcing the rest of the plane to have vegetarian instead. I was sat in 41G. Awkward seating arrangement. Worst seat ever! Super cramp, making a 9hr flight very uncomfortable." Pros: "The crew" Cons: "The served dinner 45 minutes before landing, kind of a waste at that point, 2 hours before landing would have been better. Also, parents need to parent their children instead of letting them bother other travelers while they watch movies." Cons: "It was Air Canada. Terrible service. Staff needs education on where to take travelers thru the immigration locations. Wasted time going to different locations and time is an essentence! Too many changes of staff from one location to another when it came with wheelchair assistance. One staff was on her personal phone!!! Had 3 different changes of hands then still did not get us to the right terminal, had to run to make the flight! Is that how you treat a 86 years old traveler?" Pros: "Service was excellent, food was good, everyone was friendly and nice." Cons: "Everything was OK."
