Cons: "The movie selection could have been much better for such a long flight." Pros: "Just excellent. Excellent crew, excellent food, excellent aircraft, and excellent leg room. No recommendations." Cons: "Very good airline except for the fact that the staff at Narita airport." Cons: "I might have missed it but the useful information of the weather of the destination was not announced this trip. Some pilots make the flight more personal with their messages with their PA system. No need to be interrupted a movie we are enjoying for the promotion of inflight purchase though." Pros: "The crew members polite and nice." Cons: "To time the food service more evenly. Left side passengers were served a meal and finished before the right side was served food." Pros: "JAL services on the plane is great. Food is much better than other companies. Ice Cream after dinner is great. Flight attendants are polite and nicer than other companies. Interior of the airplane was newer and comfortable." Cons: "N/A" Pros: "The level of care and attention that was given to my comfort during the flight was extraordinary. Also the economy was much better than any economy i've ever come to expect from other airlines." Cons: "The boarding I didn't know at first where to go to get to the gate. Having to exit and then re-enter the airport was a pain and further complicated my boarding. But that was not JAL's fault and is on SFO." Pros: "Very smooth ticketing and boarding on Tokyo to Manila." Cons: "In LA terminal, instead of the gate number the airport labeled my flight as “TBIT.” Not being local, I had no way of knowing it meant Tom Bradley International Terminal. I stayed near another gait that had international flights, and it turned out the gate was clear on the other side of the complex, which is obscured by construction. If I hadn’t asked one of the workers there I would have missed my flight." Pros: "Very helpful and polite" Cons: "I got a sore but comes the seat was not very padded" Cons: "The attendants were very pleasant and efficient. I will certainly prefer to fly JAL, especially if you could offer the lower rates. On the down side, it was very difficult to contact their customer service line. However their online help desk was very responsive." Pros: "Crew was super nice and the food was good (for plane food)! Really appreciated that they had snacks and chocolate on hand for hungry passengers throughout the flight. A 17 hour plane ride is never the best, but Singapore Air made it as pleasant as possible. Also, we booked on Kayak and was routed through a third party vendor JustFly, which I was a little worried about - but our booking went off without a hitch." Pros: "Excellent crew and very well dressed and always smiling" Cons: "The lights were switched off for a very long time. That can be avoided" Pros: "The crew did a wonderful job of anticipating needs and having all the little ammenities you could want." Cons: "They gave you a menu at the start of the flight but didn't serve any of that food, and the food wasn't very good" Pros: "Handset to control screen didn’t work. Airline reimbursed me with $75 voucher for inflight duty-free shop." Cons: "Aircrew took my carry on away while I was waiting to board saying it was too large; left me without the essential items I wanted during the 19.5 hours in the air and two plane changes. Other people were allowed to keep carry ons bigger than mine so I don't understand why they did this." Pros: "The plane was new. The in flight entertainment system was good, although I never got to experience it fully because the Flight attendant kept switching it off, as I had paid extra (an arm and a leg) for a “bulkhead seat”" Cons: "The service was beyond awful! The Flight Attendants had a “could care less” attitude. I had special ordered a meal, and they gave me the wrong one. I did not want to make a big deal, so I just ate it. Then they did not offer any beverages when the meal came! I literally had to beg them to make me their famous “Singapore sling”. Shocking really!!. When I had my coffee, my request for cream and sugar went ignored THREE times. Finally they grudgingly gave me only cream, rendering my coffee undrinkable. .....And the list goes on. Never ever will I travel on this horrid airline again!" Pros: "Satisfied and feel good on Singapore airlines, definitely will consider next trip" Pros: "We loved the service, quality of food, entertainment, and cleanliness of Singapore Airlines flight!" Cons: "Economy is still tightly packed with limited leg room considering the distance traveled." Cons: "In spite of ordering vegetarian food, was offered a non-vegetarian option and was told that is Asian vegetarian. Food quality was bad too." Pros: "The cabin crew was great." Cons: "1. Flight seats are too congested on flight.. 2. Not too many indian movie choices 3. Some reason, while booking the flight, the KAYAK site had not asked for food choice. And the airline does not carry any extra vegetarian food. This had caused some inconvenience." Pros: "I had to pay two tickets for same flight from Islamabad to San Francisco and going from San Francisco to Islamabad it’s been cancel and I am fighting for my money back they don’t want to refund it" Pros: "Food is amazing, planes are good." Cons: "The boarding crew at the gate did not say anything while weighing the carry on bag. I was ask to go to another person who issued me check in baggage sticker and told me to hand over your baggage to a person inside. At last he mentioned to not put any valuables in that bag. My carry on bag was just 1lb extra and the first person could have told me right away and I would have thrown away chocolates and brought down the weight to permissible limit. In general passenger do carry valuable stuff in carry on bag. I had to follow whatever I was told." Pros: "For an economy seat, was very comfortable!! Love the food." Cons: "They delayed the flight over entertainment system and that caused me to miss my connection" Pros: "Overall a decent flight." Cons: "Didn’t like the boarding experience. You have somebody look at the boarding pass but then they sent us to a waiting area. The waiting/boarding area didn’t have space to make nice lines fir boarding so it was pretty haphazardly organized. You really can do better." Pros: "Cleaningness" Cons: "Main problems at Dubai airport. Employee at the airport charged me money for the same luggage that Newark employees said it is according to air line rules. That shocked me. I didn’t buy anything from Dubai. I think it’s not right." Pros: "The a380 business class was the greatest flying experience I ever had. Second to NONE! Must try and book if possible. I fly a LOT and this was just absolutely amazing." Cons: "Nothing really! Although they do run out of food options so sit as far in the front as possible." Pros: "nothing out of ordinary" Cons: "The aircraft has no or little serviceable inflight entertainment. The food offered on board is really bad. Any additional water has to be paid for" Pros: "Horrible experience!!!!" Cons: "1. Emirates has only one piece option. With Laptop bag weighing about almost 5kgs, you are left with just 2kgs which the carry bag itself would weigh. Not sure, how Emirates is getting away with this discriminatory attitude, while rest of airlines do allow -Carry on + a personal item. 2. There is no check on the carry-on weight at SFO airport. While in DXB, they entice customer to buy all duty free and then when it comes to boarding, you will be 'shocked'. No more than 10kg allowed. 3. You will be directed to read instructions before boarding. Then the corruption deal starts...read point 4 4. The man will say, remove anything in excess of 10kg or pay extra luggage, knowing very well, that people buy duty free at DXB. 5. Once you start negotiating, then the deal-making starts... 6. I managed it. More on Facebook review..." Pros: "Good serevice" Cons: "food provided is not good. All western style most passengers are from Asia" My Tv don’t work the whole from Doha to New Delhi. Overnight didn’t work from Bos to Doha and had to eat food without light Good and comfortable flight Helpful crew Decent food and drinks Qatar said few times that the luggage will be at the final destination but they were wrong. Please check where your port of entry is at the destination. This is where the luggage would be. The food was terrible. Was humiliated at Doha airport, treaded like a cattle class traveler, I hold platinum pro status with AA and I don’t fly economy even domestic but was made to travel in the middle seat in economy class and boarding zone 3 and was denied lounge access at Doha airport. Never was humiliated like this before. Crew members service are at its best Seating area is very compact, could be better Boarding was delayed by 2 hours since the machine that assigned boarding passes broke down and we were left waiting to drop our luggage Excellent service and very comfortable business class for a long journey. Carry on bags in business class weight limits The boarding was very unorganized, they had my dad “83 years old “ stand for long time to Wait in the line then stand behind the counter, we had two kids with us but the separated my dad from us for long time Pros: "Awesome crew and comfortable flight. Food was good also!" Cons: "Nothing really. There was plenty of room this flight so wide and I had the ability to sleep a little more comfortable." Pros: "The cre was really nice and very attentive."

The airline did offer a hotel to stay in, but no other apology or explanation was given to about 15 of us who missed a connecting flight." Cons: "My monitor isn’t really working after rebooted. And the audio hole wasn’t tight enough" Pros: "Terrible seats! It keeps getting worse." Cons: "Timing of leaving the airport! It was delayed and I missed my international flight" Pros: "It was Ok.

We could hardly catch connecting flight" Pros: "Food was good, boarding was fast and efficient" Cons: "Smallest seats I’ve seen in a while. Very uncomfortable. Still haven’t announced baggage carousel but that’s jfk for ya. WiFi didn’t work on flight either." Pros: "Good movies and tv selection. Seat next to me was empty, so that was great." Cons: "Nothing" Pros: "Call back service was best part." Cons: "Booked ticket through venture card points. This meant that the email address and phone number to contact us in the event of changes was mediocre information. I was informed from Tripit that the flight was delayed, not by Delta. Reservation personnel took logical course of action to find new flight for connection that we could make because of delayed initial flight. I would recommend that they first see if there is an earlier initial flight that the customer could make, then look at finding later connecting flights. We found out about delay 8 hours prior, so we had plenty of time to get to the airport earlier. Total delay required me to take additional day off of work." Pros: "The crew are very friendly, positive and have good sense of humor." Cons: "The flight got delayed badly" Pros: "Everyone was really nice and responsive." Cons: "Seats are a little older.
