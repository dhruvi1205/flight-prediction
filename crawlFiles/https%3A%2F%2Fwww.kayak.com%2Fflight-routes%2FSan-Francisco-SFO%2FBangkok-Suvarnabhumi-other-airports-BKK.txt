I was impressed. Very eager to assist flight crew First time on Starlux. I was impressed. Very eager to assist flight crew Premium Economy on Starlux- a worthwhile way to cross the Pacific. This is a great premium economy experience. The seats are comfortable, wide and provide decent foot rests. The seatback TV is large, high resolution and plenty of content. Bluetooth connection for your headset and control from your phone is available. Food was decent and in line with the cabin class. The seat could be improved by providing more lower leg support especially for taller guests (6ft myself). Cabin crew will be moving up and down the aisle a lot since the galley is in front. Screen size was nice. No vent when hot, food was not good Wish plane type had more restrooms… Care and consideration from stewards and stewardesses was so great Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "The seat, the food, the services, the boarding could have been better!" Pros: "Very friendly staff with excellent service. Bottled water in every seat upon boarding. Lots of leg room, and love the outer earphones they provide!" Cons: "More movie selections" Pros: "The crew was very friendly, and I was happy to be seated in a 2-person row." Cons: "Nothing the crew could do- a lot of turbulence and food served past midnight!" Pros: "Fortunately plane not full and was able to use adjacent seat(s)." Pros: "Overall good, comfortable, nice and food and entertainment was very good quality." Cons: "I didn't realized we were on a code share flight from Seoul to Hanoi until we got to check in counter and they couldn't issue boarding pass even though it was a through check in for till Hanoi. In our booking itinerary it was printed as Korean air with a small print that said operated by jinair. It wasn't so bad but the hassle of going to another terminal to board and being in a smaller aircraft after a long flight wasn't the best." Pros: "The amount of times i was fed" Cons: "My seat. I wanted to upgrade and they said no, but it wasn't full" Pros: "Great customer service. Flight attendants showed passengers a lot of attention. Well done." Cons: "The plane was way too hot! Being trapped in a stuffy plane for 5 hours and sweating was the worst!" Pros: "Great service, good meals and frequent beverages at no charge. From the paper slippers to the warm wash clothes that were passed around at one point, I’ve never been better taken care of on a plane. Passengers comfort was taken into high consideration." Pros: "The food was very delicious on this trip. I had the seafood dish. Very tasty." Cons: "The movie selection wasn't that good. I was hoping to see the latest Star Wars movie." Pros: "New plane or so it seemed. Crew very attentive to needs. Nice entertainment system with large screen." Pros: "The cabin crews were excellent. Food was delicious. Lots of leg room in Economy class. Overall had a great experience" Cons: "none" Pros: "Crew was amazing and very comfortable seat" Cons: "Food can be better and Entertainment was poor There should be more choices available. WiFi was spotty only 150 MB was available after paying. It should be free in business class like other airlines" Pros: "Polite, attentive, and amiable staff show they take pride in their top notch service. Entertainment options (movies, documentaries, travel guides) on screen are also a huge plus." Pros: "The flight was late checking in. The staff handled the situation well and kept the passengers informed." Cons: "Couldn’t print or get boarding pass for this connecting flight which was a bit annoying. Other than that, everything was amazing" Pros: "Food and services were great" Cons: "There were not a lot of selections on the TV." Pros: "The staff on ANA are super friendly. The legroom on their big planes--even in economy--was excellent." Cons: "The food was okay but not great." Pros: "The plane came from LAX was 45 minutes late...but not a problem.....still ok" Pros: "Service, Cleanliness and Overall Quality" Cons: "We got lie flat cubicle seats on the way out but just tilt seats on the return, both on new 787's. After a 11 hour flight in lie flat cubicles and connecting to a standard recline BC seat is a bit painful." Pros: "Crew was super nice and the food was good (for plane food)! Really appreciated that they had snacks and chocolate on hand for hungry passengers throughout the flight. A 17 hour plane ride is never the best, but Singapore Air made it as pleasant as possible. Also, we booked on Kayak and was routed through a third party vendor JustFly, which I was a little worried about - but our booking went off without a hitch." Cons: "Rather long wait at business check-in, friendliness there ok, on board service slow with the champagne, old aircraft with old configuration of seats, nothing really bad, but it's not like this that you win an airline of the year award!" Pros: "I liked that on the longest leg of my trip - I had an entire row to myself to stretch out. Im old, things like that are important...along with compression socks...haha!" Cons: "I think the food - I dont know exactly what, because we're on a plane - but I think it could be a bit more appealing? More greens, colors? Not sure, but it was okay." Pros: "The crew did a wonderful job of anticipating needs and having all the little ammenities you could want." Cons: "They gave you a menu at the start of the flight but didn't serve any of that food, and the food wasn't very good" Pros: "Everything. New plane amazing food on a two hour flight Great new entertainment system on the seat back." Cons: "A little more leg room." Pros: "Handset to control screen didn’t work. Airline reimbursed me with $75 voucher for inflight duty-free shop." Cons: "Aircrew took my carry on away while I was waiting to board saying it was too large; left me without the essential items I wanted during the 19.5 hours in the air and two plane changes. Other people were allowed to keep carry ons bigger than mine so I don't understand why they did this." Pros: "Staff very attentive not disturbed after meal The smiles and demeanor of the staff" Cons: "The flat bed is not comfotable needed help from attendanr all the time felt like i was constricted" Pros: "The plane was new. The in flight entertainment system was good, although I never got to experience it fully because the Flight attendant kept switching it off, as I had paid extra (an arm and a leg) for a “bulkhead seat”" Cons: "The service was beyond awful! The Flight Attendants had a “could care less” attitude. I had special ordered a meal, and they gave me the wrong one. I did not want to make a big deal, so I just ate it. Then they did not offer any beverages when the meal came! I literally had to beg them to make me their famous “Singapore sling”. Shocking really!!. When I had my coffee, my request for cream and sugar went ignored THREE times. Finally they grudgingly gave me only cream, rendering my coffee undrinkable. .....And the list goes on. Never ever will I travel on this horrid airline again!" Pros: "Satisfied and feel good on Singapore airlines, definitely will consider next trip" Pros: "The crew and food was great. The legroom not so great." Pros: "Flight is online" Cons: "Flight Attendants performed acceptable. They pushed the table cart and hit me twice without apologizing." Pros: "Clean plane" Cons: "Food was horrible, flight Attendants are professional but cold as ice." Pros: "Clean and efficient. Catered to our needs. Definitely would travel them again." Cons: "Since I traveled with my daughter (4yo), I got to board early from LAX to TPE but my second flight from TPE to BKK, I had to wait till they called my zone seat. I was holding my daughter at that point since they took away my stroller way earlier than the boarding time. I would like to ask for the same standard of parents traveling with children who are 6 or younger to board first so they can get settle and these patents are tiring from dealing with their children during the flight. They are extra tired than regular passengers." Pros: "Food was great and the crews were helpful. They do offer snacks/drinks in between meals. For those who do not know, they do offer wine as a drink in the Economy class (usually red wine)." Cons: "Speakers are not good during announcement. I can barely hear it. if they can improve that, that will be great." Pros: "I enjoyed the movies, the food was good, and services" Pros: "Personal in-seat entertainment; chinese breakfast (jook) was good. Very nice pillow and blanket in economy" Cons: "Special meal (vegetarian Hindi) was terrible. Seats didn't recline much in economy class. Bathroom not cleaned very often." Pros: "Crew was nice. Having an empty seat next to me helped. But a 13+ hour flight in economy can only be so good." Cons: "No issues really!" Pros: "The crew was great, but inconsistent as the flight got closer to our destination. The food was okay, but the crew tried to keep your cup full of coffee or tea after the meal. We also received slippers to wear inside the plane which were great so that you didn't need to keep your feet in your shoes for the duration of the flight. The infotainment variety is actually pretty good with new home releases of movies as well as lots of other non-movie options. We arrived on-time and the take-off and landing were comfortable." Cons: "Boarding was a little disorganized. The infotainment system was not intuitive as to how to initiate even though the selection was pretty good and the flight status monitor is not helpful at all."
