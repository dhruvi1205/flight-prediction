Cons: "As expected this is a commuter flight so very stripped down in terms of amenities. Tight plane seating and those overhead bins just barely accommodate the carry on." Pros: "The crew was good and boarding was super efficient" Cons: "No entertain on the plane. Since when YTZ offered no more complimentary drinks and some snack?" Pros: "Very convenient, non stops and airport is close to downtown" Cons: "Captain said the 1 hour delay was due to bad weather in Washington DC but there was no bad weather in DC. He should have said the truth. I was in flight 729 from Toronto to Washington Dulles airport on 7/7." Cons: "The 4pm flight not leaving at 10pm. Or at least being informed that the flight was gonna be delayed before 3 pm" Cons: "I was required to pay for my carryon, which I was never informed during my booking." Pros: "I felt like I was taken advantage of by porter airlines" Cons: "They didn’t tell me I had to pay 110$ to bring on carry on luggage! Unacceptable. I will never fly porter again." Pros: "Porter airlines is efficient and the customer service is the best I have experienced." Cons: "I miss the free amenities that they used to offer at the Billy Bishop airport, but the newly renovated airport is nice!" Cons: "Our checked in bags did not come out on the carousel, instead they had been sitting on the ground beside another carousel - with no notification. There was a handful of us waiting 30+ mins for our bags and no one around to assist." Pros: "n/A" Cons: "Was not offered a flight back to Ottawa, had to find a ride from Toronto to Ottawa once we landed .6 hours driving. See above." Pros: "The seats were comfortable and even roomy, compared to many other airlines." Cons: "Two minor drawbacks: (1) In the Porter lounge, where I was stuck between connecting flights, the cost of food was too high. (2) The weather buffets these small planes more than would be the case with jetliners." Airline Rep at Gatwick condescending and a very poor representative for this airline did request his name but he refused. Will certainty think twice to fly with this airline in future. Pros: "Yes for thé seat" Cons: "Bene avisé for thé Velay and ont at thé airport 6hrs lost" Pros: "The crew was good with the equipment they have. The aisle is to narrow to walk down normally. To use the wc it is almost impossible with the cart in the aisle and other passengers . I am tall and the seats are cramped and not enough space between them." Cons: "Our flight going down was 1.5 hrs late departing... Mechanical and over an hour late returning.....another mechanical ." Pros: "We were upgraded to premium economy for free at check-in. The crew was very kind" Cons: "We did not enjoy the entertaining system as the headphones were not complementary. The food was quite okay but quantity was sparce and no cheese provided. Also service was slow. Drinks were served 10 minutes after meal ☹️" Pros: "Crew amazing. Passengers great" Cons: "Seats are way too small. Aisles way too tight. Recent acquisition by air Canada must improve passenger comfort." Cons: "Exit seat wasnt a full exit seat just a slightly larger row and did not recline. Seats were smaller than usual too." Cons: "The only thing Air Transat could do better is punctuality. They do everything else very well and then spoil it with late arrivals and departures." Pros: "The crew was amazing. They were super friendly and attentive. Amazing service!" Pros: "The crew was awesome, and the seating was comfortable and lots of room" Cons: "We found everything awesome" Cons: "Stroller was not at the gate. We had a connecting flight. Had to go out and check in again to collect the stroller." flight was cancelled at an hour's notice- it appears that when flights are not full, customers are left to fend for themselves. I missed my one and only conference in 6 years, and the 900$ charge was not refundable. Although the flight was delayed, the crew was nice. It was a smooth trip. The plane was on time which is a big deal now. I wish they had TV screen on every seat to watch entertainment. I was hungry and can't afford the airplane fare they offer. Good thing I now know that if you;re not buying the food you're second class. Cheap warm coffee and no cracker. Pros: "The flight was on time." Cons: "The cabin announcements were rapidly spoken and hard to understand. The seats are too close together. The flight was overheated, stuffy air, too hot." Cons: "Lost my baggage even though I actually watched them transport it to the airplane from the airplane window. Brutal." Cons: "There was no coffee or tea available on the flight" Pros: "nothing" Cons: "The worst flight I have ever had. I am tall and this large plane was fit only for dwarfs. My knees were jammed into the seat in front of me and I could not move during the 3.5 hour duration. As a result of this experience I will NEVER fly air canada again. From now on it's whatever airline can treat it's customers with dignity." Pros: "Many airlines have code share flights but it is better to buy ticket directly from the original airline as they keep on ignoring the code share flight bookings" Cons: "Till last moment we were kept hanging if we will board or not as no seat number was allocated. I believe it was as we were from the code share airline not the real one" Pros: "Flight attendant gave me more accurate info about the luggage proces. Information at check-in was incorrect." Cons: "1) incorrect luggage info in LIR 2) very late flight" Porter Airlines7.7 Air Transat7.2 Air Canada7.1 Book cheap flights from Toronto to Orlando Recent one-way flight deals Only flying one-way?
