Wish Southwest had a power source to plug iPhone's into; wish Southwest also served up better snacks. Otherwise, the service & seat choices, if you check in on time for your flight, are excellent. I'm also happy to say that this particular flight had no delays. Pros: "Crew took covid seriously" Cons: "The flight was empty enough for ppl to have their own rows" Pros: "The crew was amazing and helpful, the plain was clean and pleasant flight" Pros: "Great service and very helpful when needed assistance." Cons: "That Southwest take out of business Spirit because this was my flight home and it was great." Pros: "Crew went above and beyond!" Cons: "I still don’t like not having an assigned seat." Pros: "Always great crew with Southwest." Cons: "Honestly all planes are so cramped these days - not only SW, but I wish there was more space always." Pros: "The crew on southwest is fantastic, and I enjoy the fact they have no assigned seating." Cons: "I wish the snack options were better. But otherwise had a very good experience flying southwest" Pros: "Boarding was smooth and quick for as full as the plane was. Crew was great!" Cons: "Was warm when we boarded and even hotter before we took off." Cons: "Had 8 hours delay. Many other flights were delayed or cancelled." Pros: "Crew was funny and had a sense of humor, especially regarding the safety instructions." Cons: "Free Wifi. Paying for it is silly as ticket prices are expensive anyways." Pros: "The seat was nice." Cons: "Offered water or Orange juice in a can due to a short flight. I may recommend no canned orange juice, due to the quality ingredients and something more freshly squeezed for health benefits. And offers coffee or tea." Pros: "Good crew, did a good job making us feel good for a delayed late night flight." Cons: "For some reason air was never turned on. Air only seemed to flow once we were moving but sitting at the gate and once back on the ground taxing it got very hot again." Cons: "No seat-back entertainment on a long flight is not ok. If there was warning about that during the booking process, it was too subtle and I missed it. It was an unpleasant surprise. Also, the seats are just so stiff and uncomfortable. If this was a 3-hour flight, fine. But nearly 6 hours, no." Pros: "Comfortable seats and smooth red-eye transcontinental flight." Cons: "If there weren't a 15-minute delay due to maintenance." Pros: "Even though I was in Group C, I was one of the first to board (Groups A, B, and C were called to board all at once). Since the gate agent said the flight was full and there would be limited space for carry-on bags, being one of the first on the plane was nice. The leg room (I'm 6'2") was good." Cons: "The crew only did one pass through the cabin with soft drinks. Perhaps because it was a red-eye? Anyway, on a nearly 5 hour flight, I would have liked more than one small cup of refreshment." Pros: "The two member of the crew were very welcoming and kept a very good sense of professionalism along with adjustments to every passenger. I can consider myself a frequent flyer and it’s relieving to have a crew like that." Cons: "I would appreciate a quicker and just a little bit more organized check in and maybe some different snacks that will make an airline stand out." Pros: "Crew was amazing." Cons: "Seats are probably the most uncomfortable I’ve ever sat on." Cons: "Delay on takeoff and a delay on arrival. Flight Attendants never offered headphones for purchase to watch in filght movie/TV." Pros: "Super easy boarding and friendly staff." Cons: "I am 5'11 and my legs were literally touching the seat in front of me the whole time." Pros: "I missed my flight." Cons: "Help me get my money back for a miss understanding" The flight itself was fine.. the customer service was amonst the worst I’ve seen. When booking my flight, I selected my window seat as I always do because when I’m flying alone so I can rest against it without worrying about falling asleep on anyone.. Then when it came time to check in, there was no record of my seat selection and the only window that was left cost me an extra $74. I called and they said there was a glitch when I booked the first time and there was nothing they could do about it.. Meanwhile the only reason I was flying JetBlue was because I had a $50 credit from the last awful flight we had that was delayed for four hours… So it actually cost me more to use that credit. Never flying with them again. One of the worst experience. People from Saudi in general show nasty attitudes. They act like they own us. Or the world is theirs. Rude behaviors aren't acceptable. They have a bad accident and don't even know how to speak properly but they blame me for that and makes fun of me and laughs when I said I'm going to BANGLADESH. Pros: "The crew was nice. My seat was ripped. There was some type of tape by the window. The flight was late and wasn’t informed" Cons: "Communication with travelers if a flight will be late and better aircraft" Cons: "The stewardess could have done less talking over the plane intercom" Cons: "Flight was delayed, communication of flight delayed was not mentioned on boarding pass and gate change as well. Poor communication among staff! Plane was not cleaned well. I wiped my chair, tray, window and wipe was all grey/brown dirty. Yuck! Very disappointing jetBlue. You used to be my favorite but no more." Cons: "Two very sick people were allowed to fly and were not denied boarding during these times of Covid19. We actually had to taxi back to terminal to remove a very sick passenger. JetBlue #100 March 17, 2020 10:12 pm from Los Angeles to Fort Lauderdale." Cons: "Despite the delay of almost 3 hours (which we were informed much earlier than getting to the airport at) the plane was 40% empty so can’t complain at the end of the day" Pros: "The seats were great and the crew was also good." Cons: "The sound system at the seat I was assigned was not operational." Pros: "Jet blue flights seem generally good. Like the WiFi access to be Able to use flight time efficiently." Pros: "Snacks and new interior on A320" Cons: "Almost 4 hour delay and no Wi-Fi. When I complained to JetBlue I received a pathetic $15 credit." I was flying from nyc jfk home to Miami and I used a flight credit from delta since they destroyed my bag earlier that year. On this return flight I landed retrieved my bag and noticed when I got home that delta ripped a hole in my bag and got one of my belongings caught up wrapped around the wheel of my Tumi bag!!! Oh and now their policy says they won’t replace it. Pros: "Entertainment on flight." Cons: "The boarding crew was not helpful and rude. Traveling is stressful enough, not having a boarding crew be able to answer simple questions made the rest of the experience bad" Pros: "The crew was great. The pilots too." Cons: "The audio and video at my seat did not work correctly." Pros: "Crew was great, check in was fast. Overall great experience." Cons: "Nothing, really. Airlines unfortunately can’t make people patient or polite, & I can’t afford a private jet, so I’ll have to settle for an eye roll or twelve." Cons: "The food on the plain or snacks were to poor and not that tasty." Pros: "WARDA at the Miami Gate H07 was awesome. She went above and beyond. Everyone else was very helpful but you can get tell she does more than the norm. LOVE LOVE LOVE the free entertainment in the individual seats. Perfect for families!" Cons: "No complaints" Cons: "Tightly packed seats made for discomfort. My knees were touching the seat in front of me." Cons: "If you can get it he people at the desk to stop making announcements while there are announcements being made over the airport PA system that would be great. Especially when the person chosen to speak has a heavy accent and it’s competing with other announcements. My over 50 ears can’t make it out." Pros: "We got earlier than expected to our destination" Cons: "Perhaps educate passengers on the new Delta process of boarding. Too many passengers where disorganized; the crew tried very cars to direct people" Pros: "Absolutely nothing" Cons: "Even though there were flight/seats available, Avianca did not make them availability to flight changes and only for new reservations. Extremely disappointed at you fraudulent business practices." Pros: "The attention of the staff and punctuality at the departures" Cons: "The food" Pros: "Absolutely nothing" Cons: "Everything first every single flight taken was delayed by at least 30 mins and not on time, then they played last minute rescheduleds in which they over booked by like twice the amount of people on flight and offer a mediocre 100 dollar travel voucher to make up for it to get on the next flight that’s 4 hours later. Since no one took that offer they ended up rescheduling it and stopping in other places to ale up for the lack of space, what was suppose to be a 6 hour flight turn in a 12 hour flight." Cons: "People were NOT following instructions at boarding time... even though they were giving us instructions about who was boarding... I mentioned it to the agent when I boarded and he replied “No, that’s not true” when I was seeing who was boarding and when... if families with children were called... even single travelers were boarding the general boarding line... nobody really cared" Cons: "I was told hours before my flight that my flight was delayed due to weather in the NYC area and that the new flight time was two hours later. There were no weather issues at this time. This delay made me miss my connection and the only option was for me to have a 24 hour layover in Bogota, Colombia. As a woman traveling alone this was not acceptable to me but I had no other choice. I got a hotel room for the evening and tried to make the best of it. I was not offered any compensation for this inconvenience, nothing, not even an offer to pay for my hotel room. Similar things happened to three other people in my group that I was meeting in Peru all traveling from different locations. I lost an entire day in Peru because of this. On my return flight Avianca changed the times as well and I was forced to take an earlier fight home the day before I was scheduled to leave. I therefore lost a total of two days of my vacation because of Avianca and they did NOTHING to compensate me for it. STAY AWAY FROM THIS AIRLINE!!!" Pros: "The food was mediocre." Cons: "The customer service was terrible. Our connecting plane had not left yet and they did not let us on. They proceeded to tell us that our only option was to stay the night and take another flight the next day. Us and 10 other people had to get into an argument with the staff in order for something to be done. After begging, they finally said they would put us on an earlier flight the following morning and they put us in a hotel. The staff did not care about us or our missed flight/wasted money that we paid for the hotel at our destination that night. It took 30 minutes for a manager to give us the time of day. Horrible experience. It's really shocking that this is how the company treats its customers." Pros: "Food. As usual with avianca was amazing." Cons: "The staff. Completely unprofessional. Flying executive from SJO to JFK with the Costa Rican staff was amazing. This one compared, was deplorable." Pros: "Crew service inflight are very well trained." Cons: "After I checked in online, I noticed that my flight was delayed from 9 pm to next day at 3 am. I called the help desk and after 40 minutes and 4 different people they said that in fact that the flight 008 from Bohota to Miami was delayed. Very Poor communication between company departments and poor communication alerts to costumers. In addittion, the only explanation from counter staff was "airplane maintance". Really? For an international flight from Bogota where you have located your main airplane base ? I do believe that land staff is very poorly train compared to inflight crew.
