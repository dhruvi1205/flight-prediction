Food was delicious. Lots of leg room in Economy class. Overall had a great experience" Cons: "none" Pros: "The staff of ANA are so friendly and accommodating. When checking in, the woman at the counter moved me to a window seat from the middle, free of charge. They were very patient and helpful." Cons: "The food was a little strange, I had salmon and rice as “breakfast” with iceberg lettuce side salad. The pieces of salmon were little shreds with a funky taste. Not bad, but not what I wanted on a long red eye flight. Also I wish there’d been more Hollywood movie selections." Pros: "The flight was late checking in. The staff handled the situation well and kept the passengers informed." Cons: "Couldn’t print or get boarding pass for this connecting flight which was a bit annoying. Other than that, everything was amazing" Pros: "Food and services were great" Cons: "There were not a lot of selections on the TV." Pros: "Good food. The seats were spacious enough.

Pros: "Good seats" Cons: "Took 2 hours from take off until i had a crew member ask what i wanted to eat/drink" Pros: "The entertainment system was excellent and the free WiFi was good. The food was good, it was a bit more than expected as were the numerous beverages. The service was excellent." Cons: "The free WiFi was limited to a small amount of data or two hours." Pros: "I had 4 sectors except the first one 3 of them was with unfriendly cabin crew not smiling at all not responding the calls." Pros: "Business class setup Bar Staff" Cons: "Being seated 5 rows and a bulk head away from my wife. Configuration of Two class A380 business class is at the back of the plane with all that increased movement and you have to wait for economy to exit before you can get off. Your diluting the benefits guys for economy profits." Pros: "Love the A380 - the sheer size of it allowed for more personal space. Consequently, it was a much more comfortable flight."

Cons: "In flight food in Arabic style, my brother didn't like much of that styled food. But I'm OK with it. They provided light meal ( "pide" lamb/veggie filled bread or choice of fruit). The veggie pide was a bit weird. But overall, the food was not so bad." Pros: "The flight was superb." Cons: "Nothing. Will always fly Emirates whenever I get the chance." The two meals were plentiful and excellent. The drinks were continuous. Thanks, Crew very polite; however a bit "hazard" at the end as they were rushing us off; to prepare for the cleaning team and next flight. Baggage from Berlin was delayed; however through the apps etc; they kept me aware and informed.(.did receive my baggage about 36 hours after my flight arrival). Good experience; thank you. Pros: "Amazing crew, great customer service and high level quality plane, despite only 1 hr travel, they served small breakfast and chocolate" Cons: "Despite the fact I bought my tickets with 1 hand luggage + 1 personal item, they forced me to dispatch my hand luggage stating flight was full, I refused and they said they could not allow me to board. Felt my rights violated, I HATE to dispatch luggage... and in the end there was space left on the airplane luggage storage areas. Not nice" Pros: "The crew were friendly, helpful, and attentive. I'd love to fly with them all the time" Cons: "The business class seat felt a bit claustrophobic when in lie flat mode" Pros: "I liked that it was a straight flight from SFO -ZRH. On board entertainment was great." Cons: "Seating is way to tight. Service from crew is nothing at all like it used to with Swiss. Nearly a smile from crew ( both legs of flight) mostly just hand motion when serving food. Food was a big disappointment too. It feels like all the good service is reserved only for business and first class !" Cons: "The seat bottom was very uncomfortable and made my bum sore the rest of the day." Cons: "Guy behind me kept asking for a seat upgrade and when they didn’t oblige spent the whole 11hours kicking the back of my chair in protest. I understand this isn’t the crews’ fault. But maybe the bid upgrade for seats isn’t the best system?" Pros: "Superb crew; surprisingly delicious food (better than some first class meals I’ve had in the past)." Cons: "The seat was remarkably uncomfortable. I fly business or first class when traveling overseas (prefer business class) specifically to be able to rest - this was the most uncomfortable I’ve experienced in the last few years." Pros: "This was a 12 hour flight that didn’t feel like 12 hours. They movies and other entertainment was very good with new and older movies that didn’t disappoint. The food was great all the way through to the farewell piece of chocolate." Cons: "The seats on this flight were very tight. I am 5’8 and felt super cramped. The seats themselves were not that bad just small and not a lot of space. If you fly with them don’t expect to kee anything under the seat with you. Also the whole boarding process is a big cluster! There is no real organization to the line or who they are boarding. Make sure you get in the line quickly or you could be waiting awhile." Cons: "I wanted to get some work done on my flight but I couldn't even open my laptop screen more than a few inches." Pros: "We left on time, arrived on time. Flight went well despite lasting over 10h30" Cons: "Two of the flight attrendants in our area were in a bad mood and it showed."

Cons: "Seats recline too much making difficult to get in or out because of the seat in front of you" Pros: "Everything was great" Cons: "More choice of movies, and more choice of translations languages for movies. Because longs hauliers need a lot of entertainment. Thank you very much for asking for our comfort" Pros: "The crew was super nice and informative."

Cons: "Seats to small! Food subpar! I’ll stick with Korean Air in future!" Pros: "Flight from Toronto to Hong Kong was late departing due to a snow storm. Most on the flight missed connections.
