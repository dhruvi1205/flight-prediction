I love your airline although I usually just pick the best deal but it’s always a pleasure when that option is also delta" Pros: "Crew and entertainment options were great. Aircraft was new. Boarding was smooth. On time even though we left 30 min late." Cons: "The internet was hard to connect to and the gogo options aren’t totally clear." Pros: "The crew was nice. They did a very good job under the circumstance." Cons: "The flight was delayed over an hour because of an error on Delta‘s part. They did not verify people as they were boarding. Further the person in 17 F was doing video chat as we were preparing to take off and he had very foul language throughout the flight. The crew never said anything." Cons: "Always delays , three times late before took off and than while landing ! First class seat and seat tray don’t close , tv doesn’t work how it suppose too" Pros: "The flight attendants were excellent, pleasant, and professional." Cons: "The video system went down for a period of time." Pros: "The planes are made for humans not for monkeys as in some other airlines. Leg space was way better." Cons: "I wish you could make your ticketing categories simpler. It is too complicated and cumbersome. May be you have a new category of over 75 olds." Pros: "The fight was very professionally carried out." Cons: "The gate agent hurried ineffectively to board our slightly delayed flight (around 10 min). She left open the Priority Lane and boarded all pax there, having to step 4 steps to the left to scan every boarding pass." Cons: "More comfortable than I expected for a 6 hour flight. 757 was quite spacious." Pros: "I am usually happy with Delta." Cons: "Huge smelly person invading my space. Disgusted by his hot sweat on my leg. Used up 10,000 miles and paid too much (watched the fare go down several hundred dollars) and ended up with a middle seat. Not happy." Nothing went well. Flight was calceled and had to spend extra non refundable money on a train ticket, which we are not NOT using because a new plane has come up but not for our friend who now has to sit on a 9 hour train journey, ALONE, with no one to talk to. My bags were lost in Frankfurt and no one could help me. I filled out a report at the airport, but the office there said they were too busy to give me a reference number. They said they would send me an email but NEVER did! I tried contacting SunExpress, but it is just an automated system. I tried contacting the airport in Izmir, but they were no help either. United would not help me because they said it is the responsibility of their "partner airline", although I entrusted my luggage to United at DFW to take care of my personal property and it was United who had it last in Frankfurt. I got the run around from everyone. My flight form Denver to Albuquerque was canceled without my knowledge and I had to spend 5 hours in Denver before getting on to NM. A heads up would have been nice... We had a delay of about 45min, boarding was not done by zone, breakfast is really not good. However, we were well treated by staff, everything went well and we will surely fly again with Lufthansa. We paid Lufthansa for reserved seats months before this flight. Apparently this was not forwarded to ticketing as the clerk at check-in gave us seats at the very back of the plane next to restrooms and storage. Needless to say, we didn’t sleep at all on our overseas flight. We sincerely hope that our accommodations are better when we return to the US on October 11th. Never happened. We are still in Frankfort 3 days now with 2 children and no food or money. Flights canceled and delayed 10 times and counting. Pros: "Everything is well organized, crew members were great." Cons: "Aircraft A330-300 sucks. It is SLOW! Boeng-777 did Moscow-Houston flight in 10 hours, but this A330 flew from Frankfurt to Atlanta in the same time. Shelves for baggage are small - it is not enough room for all passenger bags. Entertainment can be better. Food... It could be SIGNIFICANTLY better! Or just do not serve it et al. If I could I would not buy it." Pros: "Not much went well, sorry" Cons: "Because of bad logistics, the flight from CDG to FRA was delayed and therefore i missed my connection to AUS. Lufthansa personnel could have helped me make the second flight but didn't bother. I was rebooked on another flight through IAH which defeats the purpose of choosing a direct flight." Pros: "International flights are always the best! You’re treated like you’re sitting in first class!" Cons: "I packed a SOLID body butter that was brand new. I thought that because it was NOT a liquid but a SOLID it would be okay. Wrong! I took every precaution and even called prior to packing. I didn’t think this would be a problem. So, out it went! My SOLID deodorant was fine, though." Pros: "Great crew. Great seats" Cons: "Flight was delayed by half an hour. Mainly due to limited carryon space. During check in we offered to check in carry on luggage, but were told it would be an additional cost! If they would have checked it in that would have saved 15 minutes easily" Food could have been better. Also, choice of movies were ok. Flew business class but seats are the same as economy except middle seat is left unoccupied. No inflight entertainment whatsoever. Everything was excellent, although flight delayed however can’t control that, but what I don’t understand is why the smallest portion of food ie: bit of rice & bit of chicken (no exaggeration) no salad, no veges, nothing else, but cake & icecream later…this is just not a great reflection on the quality of airlines. People spend $1,500 on a flight surely airlines can spend an extra $1 on their passengers meals…even bread & butter can do the trick. ESP on a 8 hour flight! Cutting costs is one thing, but this is just not ok. On the morning of my travel I received an e-mail that my flight vom Dallas to London had been cancelled and re-booked onto another earlier flight which meant I had very little time to transfer. In addition I was told at the airport that I had to pick up my luggage in Dallas and drop it off again even though I had booked it as as 1 trip from chihuahua to London. Throughout my flight from chihuahua to Dallas I felt extremely stressed about the connection flight and did not appreciate that it was changed last minute on the morning of my travel. In addition since the flight was operated by AA I was not able to online check in for my connecting flight from Dallas to London and was therefore not able to select a seat and had to sit in the middle isle. Pros: "Economy is always Economy and I got what I paid for therefore I am satisfied with that fact. In addition we were on time." Cons: "All was well with the Airline and British Airways met all the safety protocol, I expected. The booking with Kayak was made online. I had questions after the booking, I called. The representatives were very helpful,. professional and courteous. Thank you." Pros: "The crew were very attentive and there was a large variety of in-flight entertainment." Cons: "I am not a heavy set guy but the seats were unreasonably close to each other, this meant that when you eat a meal your elbows push into your sides making it hard to bring food to your mouth." Pros: "Unlike my previous BA LHR-PHX flights, this one was in a 787. The humidity is much better in a 787. It makes a huge comfort difference in a 10-hour flight. As always on BA, the food was very good." Cons: "Seats were a a bit cramped. The flight crew seemed overworked." Pros: "Breakfast was great, quick loading , great staff ,leg room was much better for my 6’1” husband with a knee replacement." Cons: "Due to my husband’s knee replacement, he is always taken to another area to be searched and checked while his wallet and all of his valuables ate left on the conveyer belt unattended and could be stolen by anyone. I grabbed his stuff but they didn’t know who I was. They need a more secure policy." Cons: "My flight was changed to a later flight without giving me a reason. I was never given the option of why this happened. As a result i missed my meeting." Pros: "Crew were friendly" Cons: "Poor entertainment - no individual TV screen or choice of entertainment. Food was very poor. We were 9 min late due to crew shortages." Room on aircraft was nice main cabin. Interaction with cabin crew could of been nicer....only seen them once Flight was delayed 2 times, first from 6:30 to 7, then to 8:45 pm (the last flight out). There was almost NO information provided, and the first indication that something was wrong was the posting on the board. Gate attendants scarcely announced it. There was no effort to assist customers in finding other/ earlier flights and the assistance desk was understaffed with a painfully long line. I think the flight attendant and first class was terrific, but whoever had to work in coach where I say didn’t seem happy about it, extremely mediocre service, not friendly, just putting 1 foot in front of the other. Just seemed “over it.” Pros: "Seats weren’t too bad, the plane was clean, and the crew was nice." Cons: "Our flight kept getting delayed due to paper work AFTER we boarded. There were also a lot of people on the plane and no social distancing." Pros: "It was a safe flight back to the Phoenix thank you." Cons: "More ethical vegan options." Cons: "Chicago to Venice flight was amazing. We were in premium economy, although the seats were larger it was hard to sleep in them, we all felt it needed some back support in order to sleep better. Crew was fantastic, would fly AA again internationally" Pros: "Nothing to complain about. A nice, calm trip." Cons: "It would have been nice if members of my group could have flown together instead of being scattered around the airplane." Pros: "Staff were very pleasant and helpful. Having a disability is difficult enough but this team went above and beyond." Cons: "Reaching Charlotte terminal I was extremely disappointed. The gate attendant seamed to only want to make excuses as to why there was no wheelchair available. (Short staffed) she didn’t offer me a seat or apologize for no availability. Costumer service should be number one when you work with people everyday." Pros: "Easy boarding" Cons: "Tight seats, poor food, rude flight staff. Doesn’t anyone at American Airlines smile. Don’t they understand that we can choose to fly with an airline that has friendly crew" Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "The aircraft was very old and the seats where hard to sit the crew were not so good, we were thrusting all the trip." Pros: "Flight was nearly empty. So crew had plenty of time for customers." Cons: "Nothing" Cons: "I was in coach. I am 6’2” and my legs were pressed against the seat in front of me for the full 4 hours. Uncomfortable." Pros: "The crew was very nice. The flight was smooth and enjoyable. I was able to charge my phone and had WiFi access." Cons: "There was no entertainment except on my phone. The food was a small bag of pretzels." Pros: "This is one of the longest flights in the world, but the flight attendants were cheerful throughout the flight. There was a good selection of movies and other entertainment in the seat back viewer." Cons: "The food was mediocre. Lots of carbs, little protein, almost no fruits or vegetables. Not great for someone watching their weight." Cons: "Flight attendant assignments to our seats were mishandled. We did have any food or drink offer until 90 minutes after boarding. We were told that one of the attendants fell ill but no was assigned to take her responsibilities." Pros: "Flight was on time. Friendly crew." Cons: "It turned out that we were on stand by (without anyone telling us until the morning of the flight) and did not know if we were going to fly out. We could not select any seats at check in and only found out our seats a few hours before the flight. It was quite unpleasant and stressful as my husband and I were flying with our two children and faced a real possibility of not being able to sit together or getting bumped off a flight all together. It was a code shared flight between Lufthansa and United and each airline kept sending us to the other to get any answers or help. neither were helpful. It made it for an extremely frustrating experience." Pros: "The crew was excellent, the free entertainment was awesome. The flight departed on time, and arrived 25 minutes early." Pros: "It was a satisfying experience with United Airline from ABE shuttle bus ride (I said Shuttle) to EWR, and short plane ride to PBI. Excellent food selections at terminal C." Cons: "Too bad the DD at the terminal didn’t accept ordering via DD App." Pros: "Price" Cons: "1st Delay due to baggage and mechanical issues. Then taxied out only to be pulled back to the gate due to an issue with how they loaded the baggage. 2 1/2 hours total causing me and many others to miss connecting flights." Pros: "Gate agent was also rude when I inquired about changing it. There were clearly open seats but she wanted me to pay to upgrade. The way this company operates boggles my mind."
