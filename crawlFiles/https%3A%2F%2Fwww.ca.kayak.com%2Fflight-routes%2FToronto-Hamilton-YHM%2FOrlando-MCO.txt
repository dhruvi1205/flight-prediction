I would fly West Jet for all my flights. Seats were comfortable and leg room was good. Slight delay for boarding but nothing too bad. Would fly with them again. Cons: "Everything was great. Westjet is so much better than Air Canada!" Pros: "Could not tap opinion on previous page. Good trip. Good service. Good legroom which was covered." Cons: "Food prices." Pros: "Very nice crew. Seats were okay a bit tight, but, fine." Pros: "Great crew, on time, could charge my iPad, 2 beverage services, just an awesome job! Oh biggest - NONSTOP!" Cons: "Can’t think of anything!" Pros: "Simply took 4 mins and I was away !" Cons: "Everyone was great that I dealt with West Jet is great !" Pros: "Seats had room. Entertainment options were quite good." Cons: "WestJet has lost its Chutzpah. No longer knows it’s identity. Food choices were terrible for a 5.5 hour flight, and the couple of okay choices they were out of very quickly. Crew was friendly enough but no sparkle." Pros: "Decent flight." Cons: "Entertainment system did not work. Also they said there is USB sockets at your seat but there were none."

Although it was a direct flight, they offered drinks and snacks twice, when normally when flying I only see then come by once. I noticed Aiden seemed really friendly and kept a smile.
