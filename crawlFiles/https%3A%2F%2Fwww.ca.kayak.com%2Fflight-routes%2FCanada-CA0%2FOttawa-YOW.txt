Although I had checked in 24 hours before the flight and noted we would be checking two roll-on bags, the machines at the check in area did not produce luggage tags, and staff were unwilling to help unless we joined the long queue, a very difficult challenge.

Although I had checked in 24 hours before the flight and noted we would be checking two roll-on bags, the machines at the check in area did not produce luggage tags, and staff were unwilling to help unless we joined the long queue, a very difficult challenge. We opted to take the bags on board and, of course, were relieved of the jells and scissors in the bags at security. On board crew were then unhelpful in hoisting the bags into the overhead bins. Cons: "No Food to buy available on board. We thought we could buy something. The coffee was good." Cons: "The food could have been better. I don’t mind paying but some nicer, healthier choices would have been nice. It is airplane food so no real surprise. :)" Pros: "Crew were fairly attentive, have experienced better. Liked the Canadian entertainment options, even if very limited." Cons: "Seats were okay, the plane is really showing it's age. Movie selection was very limited, and very dated." Cons: "Because of Boeing disaster did not go to Halifax but were sent by Westjet to TO and then on with Air France. Boarding areas in TO are a long way away (lot of walking) and customs in TO is frustrating and takes a long time." Pros: "Pleasant staff" Cons: "People get shocked from the rush of air soon after they board and close their air knobs overhead. The cabin was filled with lots of new bodies that had different ordour and perfume that it was good to have a strong ventilation but due to the strong air flow... Perhaps tell ppl to keep it open." Pros: "The check-in process was very easy and friendly. The flight attendants seemed nicer than other airlines." Cons: "Minor point. They boarded the plane very early. We got to the gate 1/2 hour before departure, and were almost the last ones to board." Pros: "Dry accommodating staff all around. Thank you" Cons: "More space between people. Not much you can do I understand that. So overall great" Pros: "They were very helpful and polite." Cons: "Times have changed and they offer very little such as entertainment food options. but it was short trip and people need to adjust." I had checked in online the day before but was instructed to collect our boarding passes when we arrived. I am not completely comfortable using the automated Kiosks and always enjoy the nostalgia of speaking with someone when checking in for a flight. Upon doing so however, we were immediately asked,"did you check in online already?" To which I replied, "yes, but we were asked to retrieve our boarding passes upon arrival." She then said, "that's what those machines over there are for. We really encourage people to use those." That unfortunately sparked a series of shortness and overall poor behavior in my opinion from the woman who checked us in. I understand it was early in the morning but I am always excited to experience flying and that interaction has unfortunately left a bitter taste in my mouth to the point I will forever now hesitate to book with Porter again. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Cheers, JD Everything was fantastic, by far the best airline experience in Canada 🇨🇦! Porter uses the intelligent and logical way of boarding a plane - from the back. Unlike our porter connection this was great , smooth 2minutes at check in not 90 mins Food wasn’t great but it’s plane food , staff were great They really communicated well advised well in advance of a delay. Contacted to tell me it was almost time to go and to do a check in. I can't praise the crew enough on how fantastic they where West Jet could learn alot from Porter about customer satisfaction travelling in 14th of April and now we are in 17th , I have not received my lost/delayed bag... this is very bad and the worst part is their call center is not able to see where is it!!!! Porter is the airline that does care. All trips with Porter have been smooth and relaxing. The extras are the customer appreciation. The others just don’t do that. Pros: "Efficient check in. Liked the shuttle bus service from subway to airport." Cons: "As expected this is a commuter flight so very stripped down in terms of amenities. Tight plane seating and those overhead bins just barely accommodate the carry on." Cons: "Honestly, even if the aircraft was delayed, there is nothing one can do and just be patient. Lunch and dinner vouchers were issued, that was well appreciated!" The flight was on time, staff were professional and friendly. It was a great traveling experience overall. Thank you! 3.5 hour late leaving due to mechanical issue, crew time out and over heated plane We were “bumped” from our rebooked flight after having a boarding pass and seat assigned. No explanation except that the Air Canada Service rep said that they “f’d up”. This is after a previous 5 hour delay in Amsterdam. It was a great flight did not eat a meal on the plane I am a senior and I was travelling with 2 other friends and they got their email for check in and I didn’t then when we went to checkin my boarding pass had me as standby so you can imagine that I was in a panic wondering if I was coming home to Ottawa airport with them or not. I finally was able to get help at the counter and she was very helpful, but this worrying takes all the fun out of a great vacation. I certainly will not be flying anywhere again. I know this isn’t only Air Canada’s problem but thanks for letting me rant.😁 Did not board by zones. Over head bins were not crowded. Babies were quiet. Cons: "Flight was delayed, crew in general was disorganized, most usb charging ports weren’t working, touchscreen is very outdated" Pros: "The on-board crew were great. Super friendly and chatty. Almost a WestJet feel instead of the serious aloofness that AC is known for" Cons: "The entire HUGE MESS from booking til sitting on our last airplane. The “new reservation” system is a horrible joke. The right hand doesn’t know what the left is doing so you get completely wrong info and they won’t do anything about it. I’m a wheelchair assist and had to call 6 times to remind them to put it on my ticket even though each time I was shown that it had been added. They kept seating on the back row of the plain and blamed me for not calling ahead to “let them know I was wheelchair assist so they could reseat me” BUT...they won’t answer you call unless it’s 24 before your flight and then to check at the airport who then tells us it’s out fault cause we didn’t call more then 36 hrs ahead...YOU CANT CALL THAT FAR AHEAD...and ...get this “they don’t have wheelchair assist on my ticket/file”. I about lost my mind over the hours on hold and every different answer as to what what to do and in the end blamed us. ASTONISHING TO ME. THEN THEY HAVE THE NERVE ON-BOARD TO ANNOUNCE THEY ARE THE BEST AIRLINE IN NORTH AMERICA 2019...HORSE PUCKY!!!" Pros: "The crew was nice." Cons: "Everything is too cramped. The sound on the entertainment unit is terrible." Pros: "Nothing good to say for this flights overall." Cons: "Spent over two hours on the plane/tarmac waiting for take off. Air Canada sucks." Can't be happy with a 5 hour delay. Only given $10 voucher for food and still EVERYTHING was an upcharge during the flight. TThe first time I have ever flown with flare and both ways sucked There was no entertainment There was no food or beverage service , not even a glass of water The plane door could not be opened upon arrival I try to buy water the cabin crews told me I had to wait for them to come around with the trolley I waited over 2 hours !!!!! Literally 2 hours I was so thirsty . Lots of leg room in the front rows. Wish water was free. I don't like anything. The crew was so bad. Misbehaved badly. The worst flight. Long wait for baggage check in with only one on site attendant. The worst airlines I have seen in my life they don’t respect anyone they don’t care about anyone they lost our luggage and no one is responding. We waited for five hours to get our luggage back.🤬🤬🤬👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 Great staff. Cramped seating for someone 5 feet, 2 inches and average weight. So if you're tall or heavy -- good luck. Even if you wait until the 24 hour checkin time, you still charge for seating. Really? So either it is a less-than-pleasant experience or pay the price of a "big name" airline. And if I'm going to pay their prices, why would I fly in your cramped seat? So, in the end, you want to give less comfort for the same prices as Air Canada. Go figure.
