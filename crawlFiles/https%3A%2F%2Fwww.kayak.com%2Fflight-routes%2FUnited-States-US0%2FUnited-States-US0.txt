Flight from New York LaGuardia Airport to Miami FAQs - booking United States flights When I'm flying to any city in California and planning on renting a car, are there specific child seat laws I should know about? Under California state law, children need to travel in the rear seat of a vehicle until they are eight years old, and they must travel in an appropriate car seat or booster seat for their height and weight.

After that, children must travel in a booster seat. If I would like to fly to Florida for spring break, what are some good airport choices?

I got lots of leg room." Cons: "The flight was delayed because of a maintenance issue. We made up some of the time, but it was an issue." Pros: "Social distancing, purell wipes were handed out, food and water handed out in a baggy." Cons: "everything was great. I love delta." Cons: "There was a family with kids climbing all over the Sears. Would have been nice if the crew reigned then in a bit." Pros: "Flight was on time and boarded and de-boarded quickly." Cons: "Video entertainment system did not work at first and had to be rebooted." Pros: "We left on time and arrived early. The seat in comfort class had excellent leg room." Cons: "The food was mediocre, to say the least." Pros: "Crew were helpful and cheerful." Cons: "Flight on time! Missed connections. In hotel overnight. Missed the event I was travelling to attend!" Pros: "The plane was nice, entertainment options were great, pilot was super kind." Pros: "The crew and staff were friendly. The flight was full so they checked our bag at no additional charge." Cons: "They had no earphones for the flight from Cancun." Pros: "Crew was amazing, flight was much more comfortable. Nice selection of drinks." Cons: "The snack on the flight was brioche with a Cajun spread. The bread was great but the spread was too spicy for my tastes." Pros: "Everything. Food, staff, checking in. All were great" Cons: "Would have preferred they let me choose a window seat. I wasn’t given the option" The crew was very pleasant and professional. The boarding process in Madrid was a bit chaotic. Also, boarding a bus to get to the plain is a royal pain. Clearing customs in Charlotte, then get your bag and rechecking it, then going through TSA again doesn’t make any sense. Cons: "My flight from LAS to LAX was excellent, it was a larger plane , full and was able to stretch out. I would love to fly American Airlines more but flight times for my destinations are not always the best." Pros: "The crew was nice" Cons: "Pilots showing up on time. The flight was delayed 3 hours not due to weather or mechanical issues. Then they boarded us on the plane, let us know it was delayed 1.5 hours, then back onto the plane at that time, then waited another 1.5 hours to leave. Unacceptable. I missed my work meeting from this." Pros: "Nothing n" Cons: "Again - door broken on connecting flight as was the first leg. American needs to better maintain their planes. This is ridiculous" Cons: "Crew not attentive, even in business class. Entertainment system broken for entire flight." Cons: "3 of the crew Members were extremely rude... snarky remarks when asking very simple questions... We are supposed to have a good experience as a costumer. Not my fault the crew might be tired or having a bad day." Pros: "Power outlets at some seats" Cons: "Little entertainment choices, no complimentary food, late, charged for even the most basic seat selection" Pros: "The crew was awesome, very attentive and helpful." Cons: "The plain was very old meaning no screens, outlets, pretty much no entertainment what so ever. Seats are cramped." Pros: "The crew members had a good attitude, pilot in particular" Cons: "Two cancelled flights, a dozen delays, and 14 hours of travel later I finally had to rent a car and drive home." Cons: "It took entirely too long to board the plane. Then there were ‘mechanical issues’ that needed dealt with. Well, don’t have everyone sit on the plane for 60 minutes. Don’t continuously state ‘it’ll be fifteen minutes.’ Just give straight answers" We have taken this flight before and it is a tight connection and they were late out of denver and did not wait for us. The plane was there and the departure time had not passed but would not let us on. Next flight is very late and a connection through Newark - a big mess. Sooooo appreciate them holding the plane so we could catch the connection. Rude and condescending crew, below average food, passengers treated as toddlers. Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "100% of staff was rude and they love to nickel and dime you." Pros: "The crew were great but the inability to elevate your legs for such a long journey wasn’t too comfortable" Cons: "The ability to elevate your legs" Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "My first flight was delayed so I had to run 10mins non stop to my connecting flight to HNL. When I get to my flight they changed my seat to a middle seat. I don’t book a flight unless I have a window seat, so I asked them to change it back to a window seat. They were unable to but offered me a flight the next day, which is unacceptable. Then I arrive to my destination and I have no luggage. I was able to make my connecting flight but somehow my luggage was not. When I inquired about my lost luggage I was told to check baggage claim later tonight. No clear answer on how to get my luggage." Pros: "The price was better than spirit" Cons: "We sat on the runway for some time but made it to Dallas on time" Pros: "Crew were experienced, and worked preemptively to help a number of passengers with tight connections" Pros: "Check-in at Narita was great!!! The entire process from obtaining boarding pass to dropping off luggage took less than 3 minutes." Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "It was supposedly upgraded but my seat was shittier than the flight to Tokyo after it got delayed 7 hrs and no upgraded seat." Pros: "Staff and crew were great. Kept us informed and were willing to work with us" Cons: "Overloaded plane, then took two-hours to decide what to do. Not our fault that they overloaded the plane, yet no accommodation for them delaying us for two hours." Pros: "It was good" Cons: "All those extra fees even for a drink!!! First time on frontier not sure if I would use it again" Pros: "On time, got to our destination silghtly sooner than expected, Cheap fare, polite FA's, comfortable seats" Cons: "No negatives at all, just no extra's." Cons: "Check in counter opening for such a short period get very inconvenient" Pros: "Made good time, crew pleasant, plane clean." Cons: "Seats have no recline function, no extra head support, no entertainment of any sort. Seating choice ($13) and baggage ($38) over-priced. No snack or comp beverage except at extra cost. Original fare not that much cheaper." Pros: "Lots of leg space Friendly crew Clean aircraft" Cons: "No ability to recline chairs Charge for carry-on baggage" Pros: "Nothing . Should be called Last resort not frontier." Cons: "Not worth it for little $ you might save. They try to screw you on baggage and seating. I arrived to the gate but apparently too late to board. Yet plane was still sitting there. Due to their crappy online service which didn't check me in. When I manually did . Wouldn't print or bring Ticket up on smart phone. There for delayed me at security when boarding pass wouldn't load. Causing me to go to Frontier service desk where it took 30 mins to get my boarding pass with 3 or 4 people in line. Terrible service. Then was a $99 fee for the next flight the next day. I went with United. They took care of everything with excellent care. Never again frontier." Pros: "Boarding was quick and easy" Cons: "Delayed grting back.. sitting waiting for a gate to open up" Pros: "Boarding and flight just ok. Attendants were fine for what they had to give. They were on time and we landed early." Cons: "the add ons were not explained well. My seat cost extra which was,t explained when booked two months prior. Evidently there was only a few seats at that price. Should have gone with another airline because of the add ons the price was closer to $300 than the original $200." Cons: "same thing as above the entire experience was awful and I will never fly with this airline again.... this was my 4th round trip this year and I again will NEVER FLY FROUNTIER AGAIN!!!" Pros: "The staff was good" Cons: "The seats, even the most expensive ones are hard like a rock. I had to pay for choosing a seat on top of the ticket price. I won't fly them again" I bought coffee for me and needed cup of water for my medication but lady denied, and said she cannot give me, I have to buy it rather Very upset, very bad and very impolite of her, even on insisting for cup of water for medication, reply was negative Have some sort of beverage service free & snack like other airlines. And allow carry on luggage for free. Pros: "Cleanliness and nice staff" Cons: "A woman sitting next to me had her full size purse on her lap the entire flight and it was difficult to move. The rule is everything goes under the seat in front but it didn’t apply to her." Pros: "Crew was diligent about everyone wearing face masks" Cons: "Customer in front of me was visibly super ill, coughing and wheezing the entire flight. I don't think he should have been allowed to fly, especially during a pandemic! No organization by staff for customers exiting the aircraft at all, everyone just rushed to the front." Cons: "Everything honestly. The clarity of communication was absolutely terrible. We were strung along for 6 hours about a delay they knew was not going to be short. They led us to believe it would be a few hours even though they knew the had no crew to fly the inbound flight. Boarding process was amateur." Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "Still sitting on the runway as we speak for a total of 6 hours. The flight was suppose to be 2 and half hours. Not communication with their passengers. Watched the flight attendant tell a mother with a infant she couldn’t bring it in that bathroom. Crazy this airline is atrocious. Stay away!" Cons: "Everything was on time and even landed earlier. Very organized!" Pros: "The crew were great" Cons: "Who charges for water??? Also spirit didn't transfer my precheck over to my boarding pass and I almost missed my flight." Pros: "The seating was the most comfortable and roomy since flying Spirit. Smooth flight." Cons: "There are no complimentary beverages, not even water." Pros: "Staff at counter and on flight were nice, helpful- not their fault!!" Cons: "I was bumped from flight and I was confirmed for that flight-arrived at 11am for 12:57 bos- Chicago direct-two hours early- and finally got on a flight at 6:30pm , left at 7:00pm! So I get two free round trips, with Spirit!! That's like serving me bad food and then , to make up for it , giving me two helpings more , for free!! What a deal. If I want to arrive two days late for my sons wedding in February in DR, I'll be sure to give you a call."
