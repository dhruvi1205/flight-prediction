However, once in the air, the crew gave its usual excellent service. Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "The seat, the food, the services, the boarding could have been better!" Pros: "As always Korean Air’s attention to detail is outstanding and impressive." Cons: "Though I appreciate the consideration given to tall passengers (trying to find us an aisle seat with an empty seat beside, after boarding, for instance), I think there is more that could be done during the check-in process to seat tall passengers into emergency exits or other seats with more legroom" Pros: "The crew was amazing and accommodating as we had an infant." Cons: "Entertainment was subpar." Cons: "The seats on the plane had ample leg room, even in economy. The service was excellent. The staff was very polite and efficient. All of this made for a pleasant experience even for the long trip. Thank you Korean Airlines. I would recommend you to all traveling overseas." Pros: "Professionalism, appearance, flight attendants, provided slippers and toothbrush, seat space, great food and drinks" Cons: "The movie selection was small and a bit outdated" Pros: "Flight attendants were the friendliest and most patient I have ever experienced. Great customer service!!!" Cons: "Seats of any airplane could use improvement on comfort. But comfort was good." Pros: "The best flight I took this trip - clean, courteous, on time. I wish they flew in continental US :))" Pros: "Very clean, you’re given headphones, slippers, toothbrush and toothpaste, blanket and pillow, wine or beer at no charge to you" Cons: "On our Round trip we were delayed due to flight crew both times" Pros: "Great customer service. Flight attendants showed passengers a lot of attention. Well done." Pros: "New plane or so it seemed. Crew very attentive to needs. Nice entertainment system with large screen." Pros: "The cabin crews were excellent. Food was delicious. Lots of leg room in Economy class. Overall had a great experience" Cons: "none" Pros: "The staff of ANA are so friendly and accommodating. When checking in, the woman at the counter moved me to a window seat from the middle, free of charge. They were very patient and helpful." Cons: "The food was a little strange, I had salmon and rice as “breakfast” with iceberg lettuce side salad. The pieces of salmon were little shreds with a funky taste. Not bad, but not what I wanted on a long red eye flight. Also I wish there’d been more Hollywood movie selections." Pros: "The flight was late checking in. The staff handled the situation well and kept the passengers informed." Cons: "I was seated at the exit isle, ample of leg room, but the seats were very narrow. I barely fit into the seats. I noticed the seats behind had smaller arm rests so they had more space. The movies on board need upgrade." Pros: "Everything about this airline made my flight pleasant. The staff were polite and accommodating" Cons: "Couldn’t print or get boarding pass for this connecting flight which was a bit annoying. Other than that, everything was amazing" Pros: "Food and services were great" Cons: "There were not a lot of selections on the TV." Pros: "Excellent legroom. Very polite staff." Cons: "Buses to plane. Delayed departure. Food not tasty. Limited entertainment options." Pros: "The in-flight entertainment is fantastic, always loaded with new movies to watch. The same free drinks (beer/wine/etc)" Cons: "The boarding was terrible. They called for groups, asked everyone to form 2 lines, but after the lines were formed, closed one boarding lane. Some people were late to board for first-class, causing even more boarding delay and chaos. There were 5 crew at the boarding gate just standing and watching. I selected a seat closer to the rear of the cabin, which received much worse attention than any other flight with ANA. I didn't get asked for a drink until very late, and the second time around there were almost no drink selections available. My seat was also broken and would not recline. Aside from the actual airline, the passengers in the rear were very inconsiderate. There was a big family with several children running around/crying/playing with seat-back trays the entire 11+ hour flight. Again, this is not entirely the fault of the airline, but it was a discomfort." Pros: "Good seats" Cons: "Took 2 hours from take off until i had a crew member ask what i wanted to eat/drink" Pros: "Excellent crew. Got on just in time. Last one on the flight but they were very understanding. Loved the airbus A380." Cons: "It was great but food could have been better. Process to get onto the flight at DXB was much longer and complicated than it needed to be. Huge airport and big distance between connecting flights." Pros: "The crew was amazing and their service was very attentive to customers." Cons: "Not having crying infants onboard" Pros: "Seat was fixed for such a long flight it is hazardous to the spine ." Cons: "Allow the seat to slightly recline like any other airline" Pros: "The crew were superlative." Cons: "The seat folded to a flat bed, yet the boulder area remained raised, making the comfort level for a tall person, somewhat rest cited. My neck really quite sore as a result. Was an old plane tho, and the controls for movies , seats etc were archaic" Pros: "I had 4 sectors except the first one 3 of them was with unfriendly cabin crew not smiling at all not responding the calls." Pros: "Business class setup Bar Staff" Cons: "Being seated 5 rows and a bulk head away from my wife. Configuration of Two class A380 business class is at the back of the plane with all that increased movement and you have to wait for economy to exit before you can get off. Your diluting the benefits guys for economy profits." Pros: "Love the A380 - the sheer size of it allowed for more personal space. Consequently, it was a much more comfortable flight." Pros: "Didn’t get this flight as we were so delayed." Pros: "Good space and entertainment. Crew was excellent. Really enjoyed it." Cons: "Food. It’s plane food wasn’t impressed." For a long-haul flight, the crew did a very good job of keeping the lavatories clean and the aisles clear. My BIG complaint was that my second flight was also delayed. That's very aggravating after traveling for 18 hours already. Lovely service and excellent food and entertainment! I couldn’t have been more happy flying with air China As an elite member i was put in the back - bad Also both flight delay total more than 1 hour Cons: "Wish there were more English instructions spoken. It was mostly Thai and Chinese." Pros: "They ran things efficiently and staff was cordial and helpful if asked." Cons: "I didn't realize I was assigned middle seats for.both legs of my long 20 hour trip. It would have been nice if the person checking me in would have considered assigning me a different seat on at least one of the legs. It was fine just not amazing." Pros: "Food was slightly better than the previous flight." Cons: "Same lousy headphones. My seat had a led rest that made it harder to get in and out, and wasnt usable due to the close distance to the seat in front. What was the designer thinking? I missed the drink service if there was one, never saw water going around until right at the end. . ." Pros: "I like the new plane airbus A350-900. It was quite and very little turbulence" Pros: "Excellence in crew's attitude, promptness in service, very courteous." Cons: "A bit more bathroom diligence would have been nice, but the passengers seemed quite messy." Pros: "The crew was very attentive and helpful (ie, helped me with vegetarian options). Everyone was pleasant and friendly." Cons: "More comfortable seats, needed a back rest or thicker pillows. Will opt for premium seats in the future." The flight itself it was great nice food the crew were very nice and helpful, Checking in from Birmingham wasn't great long queues for bag dropped, And I had my hand luggage case taken away from me even though I requested to have it with me as I had breakables items. I was told I can not because of the length of the flight with no explanation at all no options was given for me to take my fragile items out of my case it was taken away with hold buggage I find the staff member who was checking me in very unpleasant !! Can we please be advise if the rules have changed about the the carry on hand luggage it will be easier to be advise on booking your tickect if we not allowed to take the hand luggage with me. Overall I had a good flight . One of their staff was so rude with discriminative. Such a reputed airline shouldn't hire such kind of arrogant attendants. The boarding was one of the worst I’ve ever experienced. The fault lays on Ohare Airport and not so much the airline. The waiting area by the gate was the size to accommodate a regional flight for 20-30 people and right next to a busy walkway. When you cramped nearly 300 passengers into that space is was unbearable. Well, in my case; the flight was delayed 1 hour, we have to wait in the plane to get green light. And the plane (probably because was a short trip) did not have entertainment or WiFi. No a good experience. Pros: "The plane size & comfort was excellent. The staff were very friendly" Cons: "N/A" Cons: "Boarding was chaotic & therefore delayed take off a little Receiving luggage was slow -@ 35 minutes from landing to luggage claim, so actual arrival was considerably later for those meeting me" Cons: "The flight from Manchester to Amsterdam has been delayed which led insufficient time for me to transfer to HK" Pros: "The crew was amazing, flight on schedule and good entertainment." Cons: "Space is just reasonable on a long flight, even if there's seats more spacious that you could choose if you pay more." Pros: "The crew was great. The soecial meal request was hadled well despite oversight." Cons: "Soecial meal request was made in advance but overlooked. Did not mind it so much as eating less is not a bad idea! To err is human." Pros: "Just as I expected. And I made my last connection easily."
