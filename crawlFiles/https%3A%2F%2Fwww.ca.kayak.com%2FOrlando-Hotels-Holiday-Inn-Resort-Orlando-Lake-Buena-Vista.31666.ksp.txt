Friendly staff. T 8.0 Very good Tin, Dec. 2018 Pros:Location was very convenient Cons:The shower curtain had a bad smell although we got it changed. It should not have been installed in the first place. M 5.1 Fair Maria, Aug. 2017 Pros:The staff was helpful and assisted as much as possible. The property is worn but fine for kids, the pool is fun. Cons:It is clear that this Hôtel is an older HI and it shows. The bathroom door stuck and it was difficult to open and close, we got locked out of our room 3 times because cards failed and the shower leaked. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Jun. 2017 Pros:We booked one night prior to our week at Disney so we could be close to the gate on our arrival day at the parks. We enjoyed it so much we decided to stay another night after our Disney vacation to allow us to maximize our time in the park on our last day and rest up before our long drive home. Cons:Nothing. We'd gladly stay there again. C 9.4 Wonderful Christine, Jun. 2017 Pros:Pool, tiki bar, large fluffy beds, blackout shades, very nice and helpful staff Cons:Some water issues (quickly made up for by perks from the front desk staff) A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Apr. 2017 Pros:Great water pressure and heat in the shower. Excellent location in regards to parks and restaurants. Cons:Bed was very uncomfortable. A 5.4 Fair Anonymous, Feb. 2017 Cons:We didn't expect immediate availability, but anything before 3pm (like noon or 1pm) would have been greatly appreciated. We checked back in at noon to see if a room had been cleaned and were given the same scripted reply "check-in is at 3, we have prioritized cleaning of your room and will call you." Bullhockey. Came back at 5:30 after never getting a call to "hopefully the room is ready, now". Of course the room was ready. People had been checking in for hours. I was told a note for early check was added to the reservation a month in advance. We also checked at 8am after an overnight flight and were told we'd get a call as soon as it was available. Very unpleasant experience. If they don't do early check-in, just say so and we could have planned accordingly instead of being jerked around and ignored. S 10.0 Wonderful Sam, Jul. 2016 Pros:The room was clean and well equipped. Very well located for Disney Parks, great to be just minutes away. A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Jun. 2016 Pros:Enjoyed security features like gated parking and entry doors. Pool area was great especially poolside bar. Staff very helpful except restaurant staff. The store in the hotel was well stocked. Cons:Applebee's as only meal choice. The staff in here was horrible. Went in for something to eat around 10 and waitress/hostess wAs less than friendly. In fact acted like my presence was a bother. Informed me that kitchen is no longer cooking and only option was Buffett that was very picked over. When i asked about seeing a menu and was room service an option she rolled her eyes and said I don't where the menus are. At that point, I said forget about it and left. Thank goodness for the store in the hotel with snacks. A 9.7 Wonderful Anonymous, Mar. 2016 Pros:Frequent, free shuttles to Disney. Very accommodating- kept our luggage in a locked area so we could go to Disney since we arrived before check in time. Cons:Only 1 shuttle per day to Universal. If you miss it, you are stuck taking a cab, driving or ubering. Expensive cab ride to the airport.
