The staff were very kind, accommodating and served us damp linens to wipe our hands with before eating, which I did not receive on the Condor flight." Pros: "Overall, a great experience." Cons: "The flight attendants were excellent overall, but one of them reacted unprofessionally when I asked her to throw something away prior to departure. (I believe it was the first class flight attendant, as I did not interact with her again after take off)." Pros: "Free movies" Cons: "First time on Alaska air, on my departure got delayed for 8hrs, then that one we end up deplaning. On my arrival, the plane got delayed again. It’s not a good experience all and all" Pros: "No hassle and easy boarding." Cons: "More room and limit on size of luggage in the overhead compartment." Pros: "The flight itself was as expected." Cons: "The flight was delayed 3+ hours with no reasoning shared with travelers. No compensation, complimentary beverage, etc. was provided." Cons: "Miss airline meals but realize this was a short flight. Everyone was great." Pros: "Everything was great" Cons: "I didn’ ask for internet but i was charged$25 I don’t know what to name it !" Pros: "The entire experience of the flight was wonderful. The boarding, the crew, the drivers, the ride... just really all excellently well done. Great Flight!" Cons: "Those video.screens are.Super Bright. Like Crazy Super Bright." Pros: "Friendly staff" Cons: "No food offered but I usually don’t eat food but some passengers were asking about the food service" I loved the crew's professionalism. The landing was unbelievably smooth, haven't experienced that in years Their system was slow so it took them well over 4 hours to complete checkin but they kept assuring us that the flight won’t leave without all the passengers as it’s their fault but at the end of 4th hour then tell us that the immigration will close for the night and the last few of us are left stranded behind. The customer service itnay open at night. The airlines does have its own crew at Toronto airport so no one to help us. Great first experience, I will definitely be flying again as soon as I can. No online check in was a bit nerve-wracking with a newer airline, and it was a bit disorganized at the airport check in but I've definitely experienced way worse with the major airlines. I arrived 2.5 hours early and had tons of time. Looking forward to new routes! Pros: "The boarding process was disorganized and chaotic. Food was OK. Crew was not unpleasant but not pleasant." Pros: "We got upgraded to business class due to getting bumped from flight." Cons: "We got bumped from our flight and split up so my wife and child had to go to Rosario on their own, and my other son and I had to take a separate flight via Buenos Aires, causing our prearranged driver to wait for many hours and significant delay and stress. Our short time in Rosario was cut shorter" Cons: "This doorbell sound was playing on repeat over the loudspeakers constantly for almost the entire second half of the flight. Drove me nuts" Pros: "I like the 2 2 seating" Cons: "Having to go to other counter to pay bag fees after check in is annoying. I get that with some fares you have to pay, but so much more efficient to swipe credit card at check in." Pros: "The aircraft was very clean, well maintained. We were 20 min late in departing because the crew waited for a passenger with disabilities to make it to the plane. That was kind. Some of the lost time was made up and this flight had no connections out of the arrival airport that day, so not a major inconvenience. Short flight, so just drink service, no entertainment. Baggage arrived promptly. All good." Pros: "The boarding process was fast. I appreciate being able to access SkyPriority boarding." Cons: "I wish my Delta SkyMiles status earned an upgrade to Business/First Class on this SkyMiles partner." Pros: "The crew inside the plane was ok" Cons: "The boarding was delayed and they didn't display the delay on the screens. When I asked the reason, 40 minutes after the displayed boarding time, they told me there was no delayed at all." Pros: "The crew was extremely helpful and friendly!" Cons: "The seats, overall, could have been more comfortable... I have somewhat of a backache after my trip." Cons: "No ear plugs offered and my iPhone jack didn’t fit." Cons: "Delayed flight planning - would have been nice to delay the flight before boarding." Pros: "Maria in Winnipeg tried to find me decent connections. She did book me into a hotel in Boston as I missed connection 3 times!!!!" Cons: "Flights that arrive and leave on time. How can one plan a trip if flights are continually cancelled or delayed. Very frustrating and a very unhappy customer." Cons: "On board entertainment was inop, making for a long (4) hours flight." Cons: "Flight was delayed almost 3 hrs. Ran out of food right before my row. I upgraded my seat but feel I got the short end of the stick." Pros: "Just a great experience Delta is still above the rest excluding Hawaiian" Cons: "Cant think of anything" Cons: "When we booked this trip via Kayak, we thought that we were booking on Westjet. Westjet knew nothing about the flight when we tried to check in." Pros: "The flight attendants were amazing. 12 people had a connecting flight and they brought a shuttle bus. You dont see that kind of service any more 10 stars for that" Cons: "Super small plane." Pros: "The overall experience on the flight was quite pleasing. The flight crew created a warm atmosphere on what was a very cold morning. Seating was not the most comfortable but the wasn't unbearable." Cons: "Delta should have a better food menu for those early flights unless the motive is to encourage everyone to eat an organic and wholesome meal prior to boarding, something we all should be doing." person sitting behind me on flight to Calgary was vaping Cons: "More than an hour late departing. Added to that it was almost an hour before luggage appeared. Not West Jet’s fault but it made us even later resulting in some of our long drive of our drive to Grand Canyon being in the dark." Cons: "The food could have been better. I don’t mind paying but some nicer, healthier choices would have been nice. It is airplane food so no real surprise. :)" Pros: "Crew were fairly attentive, have experienced better. Liked the Canadian entertainment options, even if very limited." Cons: "Seats were okay, the plane is really showing it's age. Movie selection was very limited, and very dated." Cons: "Wake people up when serving anything.. I have seen in some other airlines that one is provided with a sticker to place on your seat to show if you can or cannot be woken up" Cons: "The baggage restriction was not good at least one Checking should be allowed" Pros: "The crew worked hard to ensure that we had a good flight with minimal interruptions" Cons: "Delays always hurt, the flight was delayed yet there were no notifications and additionally the delay was closer to an hour long since boarding only started 20 minutes late." Cons: "Minor point. They boarded the plane very early. We got to the gate 1/2 hour before departure, and were almost the last ones to board." Pros: "Dry accommodating staff all around. Thank you" Cons: "More space between people. Not much you can do I understand that. So overall great" Pros: "They were very helpful and polite." Cons: "Times have changed and they offer very little such as entertainment food options. but it was short trip and people need to adjust." I had checked in online the day before but was instructed to collect our boarding passes when we arrived. I am not completely comfortable using the automated Kiosks and always enjoy the nostalgia of speaking with someone when checking in for a flight. Upon doing so however, we were immediately asked,"did you check in online already?" To which I replied, "yes, but we were asked to retrieve our boarding passes upon arrival." She then said, "that's what those machines over there are for. We really encourage people to use those." That unfortunately sparked a series of shortness and overall poor behavior in my opinion from the woman who checked us in. I understand it was early in the morning but I am always excited to experience flying and that interaction has unfortunately left a bitter taste in my mouth to the point I will forever now hesitate to book with Porter again. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Cheers, JD Everything was fantastic, by far the best airline experience in Canada 🇨🇦! Unlike our porter connection this was great , smooth 2minutes at check in not 90 mins Food wasn’t great but it’s plane food , staff were great Pros: "Great and helpful crew" Cons: "Porter airlines mechanical failure caused 13 passengers to miss connection to DC" Cons: "The flight was delayed by 2 hours . We missed our appointment and want to be compensated!!!" Cons: "The agent spents too much time attempting to rearrange the line up rather than help guests check-in, causing a backlog. When issues were brought to them, they seemed disinterested in solving the problem - water was spilled in line and when brought to the agents attention she seemed annoyed." Pros: "Hassle free" Cons: "Since it's a small bombardier the leg space is pretty restricted.. only adjustable for short flights" Pros: "Flight attendants are among the most professional and refined I’ve come across traveling anywhere in North America. It’s a pleasure flying with them." Pros: "Our flight attendant was WONDERFUL! I wish I knew her name. She was the only one with glasses. This was the ~3:15pm flight Nov 25 from Montreal to Toronto. She was very pleasant and attentive, and truly loved her job but not over the top. My friend and I were super impressed by the service of everyone but especially her. The snacks were also a very nice touch. Great prices and deals on flights" Pros: "The seats were comfortable and even roomy, compared to many other airlines." Cons: "Two minor drawbacks: (1) In the Porter lounge, where I was stuck between connecting flights, the cost of food was too high.
