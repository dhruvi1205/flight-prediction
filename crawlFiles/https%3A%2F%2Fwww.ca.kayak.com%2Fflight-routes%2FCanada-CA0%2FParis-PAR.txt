Call your customer service and you will have the answer. This was the worst experience in my life. Sorry for you. Pros: "Swiss doesn't"t always have comfortable planes but this one was super comfortable" Pros: "Not one thing about my experience." Cons: "The alertness of the staff, the boarding process, the knowledge of the staff. Not breaking my luggage!" Pros: "The in flight service was fantastic. The attendants were friendly and always smiling. The pilots flew the plane with Swiss precision. I had an economy ticket and they fed us twice and had at least six beverage passes to keep you hydrated. A blanket, pillow and ear buds were provided as part of the seat. Norwegian Air does not even cover a glass of water. They are pathetic. We will travel with Swiss Air again." Cons: "Internet service is invoiced by the megabyte and not the flight. For flights of this duration, a lump sum is a better idea." Cons: "The sitting was so very small, I never traveled so crumpled." Pros: "The crew was amazing. They left snacks and drinks out in between service." Pros: "Good crew, food was good for airline food. Entertainment offerings were good." Cons: "Too many seats, 3-4-3 configuration means not even enough room to walk down aisle without bumping people in their narrow seats." Pros: "The plane was pretty cool. I like the fact that the overhead compartments had enough room. The staff was friendly, too. The piece of chocolate is very tasty." Cons: "Food on those airplanes is always bad. There were not enough chicken sandwiches and some passengers only were given cheese sandwiches." Cons: "We were packed like sardines! My flight made me want to retire from traveling!"

Pros: "The seating in upper class is unconventional and uncomfortable." Cons: "Reconfigure seating in upper class. We will no longer be customers for that reason alone.." Pros: "Very friendly crew. The meals are good, nice variety. Hot food is hot." Cons: "Seats are not the most comfortable and sometimes the screen on the entertainment tv doesn't work that easily." Pros: "Speedy boarding and good locker space" Cons: "Lack of room in seat especially with seat in front reclined." Pros: "Excellent airline" Cons: "The business seats could have been wider. I have sat on business class other airlines and the seat was a bit wider but overall still great experience" Pros: "The crew was amazing and effiecent. Had weather delays, bag got left, but got it the next day." Cons: "We were bussed to the plane, there were long dark hairs on my pillow, and they are generous with snacks at close intervals, but the food could be much better. The ideas are cute, but the actual food is pretty basic, which is disappointing for Virgin, who I hold in high regard. Or did." Pros: "The crew where awesome and catered to every need and requirement." Cons: "need to have a slightly deeper seat pitch in premium economy to allow people out without having to wake each other up. Especially on night flights." Pros: "crew was nice" Cons: "First time flying with a partner through Delta, so they stuck us on a Virgin Atlantic flight meaning I didn't get my free Delta check in bag (a fee of $60 each way) when I have gotten it every other flight I have ever taken with them. It was also 2 whole hours late in boarding." Cons: "Not enough room with the seats if someone reclines in front of you." Pros: "You know what you are getting with Delta" Cons: "The economy seats were really tiny, this made the flight fairly uncomfortable" Cons: "When we booked this trip via Kayak, we thought that we were booking on Westjet.

Also the movies on long flights is really nice" Cons: "Quicker way to get off plane" Pros: "The on board food was amazing, nothing like I’d ever had on a plane before. I was also pleased with the choices for entertainment." Cons: "The seat was not comfortable in economy. I could not sleep and there were no air vents. Every time I tried to rest my head on the seat in front of me the screen would turn on and get super hot. I wish there was a cover or something you could turn the screen completely off." Pros: "The flight attendants were amazing. 12 people had a connecting flight and they brought a shuttle bus. You dont see that kind of service any more 10 stars for that" Cons: "Super small plane." Pros: "The overall experience on the flight was quite pleasing. The flight crew created a warm atmosphere on what was a very cold morning. Seating was not the most comfortable but the wasn't unbearable." Cons: "Delta should have a better food menu for those early flights unless the motive is to encourage everyone to eat an organic and wholesome meal prior to boarding, something we all should be doing." Pros: "Zee was our flight attendant and she was absolutely wonderful. Personable, attentive, and she made sure each and every person on the plane was comfortable and happy, going so far as to move solo passengers to empty rows so they could have more space. I wish she could be on every flight I take." Cons: "Don't call it "food." the meals were terrible. Also stop creating so much single use plastic." Cons: "It was too cold on the feet during the night. The blanket was not enough. The food lacked good vegetables. The asparagus was too tough. If you wanted to avoid sugar, you could not eat breakfast." One of their staff was so rude with discriminative. Such a reputed airline shouldn't hire such kind of arrogant attendants. The boarding was one of the worst I’ve ever experienced. The fault lays on Ohare Airport and not so much the airline. The waiting area by the gate was the size to accommodate a regional flight for 20-30 people and right next to a busy walkway. When you cramped nearly 300 passengers into that space is was unbearable. Pros: "The plane condition." Cons: "The flight attendants could have served some drinks in between the meals. They actually refused to serve something additionally when asked." Pros: "I liked how generous they were with food and drinks" Cons: "Free WiFi could have made the flight a lot better" Pros: "Due to business I travel allot so I deal with allot of airlines. This is by far the best airlines I have used. Excellent crew and airport staff. I don’t think words can express how satisfied I am with this airlines and airport. The nicest people and great service. Clean and modern aircraft. Going to try flying only with KLM from now on." Cons: "Nothing" Pros: "The crew from Kili to DarEsSalam was tired. A fresh crew worked from DarEsSalam to AMS and they were great." Cons: "The boarding process was chaotic. The passengers in the first boarding group had to fight through the crowd because there were no boarding lanes." Pros: "Food was great, movie selection too. Everything was great except for I couldn’t really get comfortable to sleep" Cons: "Not sure how to make the seats more comfortable. I have some back issues though. However, some of my travel companions slept right through the flight." Pros: "The plane size & comfort was excellent. The staff were very friendly" Cons: "N/A" Pros: "Very friendly and responsive crew. Announcements from the Capitan and chief of flight attendants are very informative and comforting. Seat positions: very good leg room (even in economy)!" Cons: "Newer airplane, as 747s are kind of outdated now, especially for long distance flights. But overall had good experience with KLM" Pros: "Staff were professional and polite." Cons: "Despite zone boarding, boarding and disembarkation were very slow. Passengers like me with flight connections were very anxious regarding missing these." Flight attendants were awful, very rude and inconsiderate for mothers with small infants traveling. Pros: "Austrian Airlines is the best! Crew, food, drinks, entertainment, and plugins were all provided, and it was all very nice (and delicious food!)." Cons: "Nothing! Love Austrian Airlines!" Pros: "Although economy, it was pleasant and okay" Cons: "I bought a business ticket but flew in economy from Tel Aviv to Vienna. I knew about it but the ticket cost was still high." Cons: "Poor selection of european films! There is a far bigger choice in e.g. Singapore airlines or Cathay Pacific. Rest was fine." Cons: "Buses to and from the plane. One driver left us in a full bus waiting for 20 minutes. When we arrived in Vienna, there was no bus to pick us up. We had to wait in the plane until one showed up." Cons: "Don’t tell passengers they can make a transfer flight supposed to leave in 20 minutes because the first flight was late, and then have the plane leave without the passengers who sprinted through the airport after having to go through customs and security again." Pros: "The staff were nice, the flight was on time. The meal was good." Cons: "There was no pillow on board and the flight was overnight." Pros: "Leg room was good.
