KAYAK’s top tips for renting a car in Los Angeles Parking garages, street parking, and metered parking are the three main parking options for cheap car rentals in Los Angeles. Many large venues have on-site parking garages you may pay for, and for an extra fee, you may get valet service as well. Free street parking is generally easier to find on the outskirts of LA and in residential areas. However, some residential areas require a permit, so look out for any signs that specify a permit is needed. Lastly, there are metered parking spaces that take credit cards and charge by the hour. Although there is plenty to do and see inside Los Angeles, one of the great benefits of getting cheap car rentals in Los Angeles is that many other attractions are only a few hours away. For example, Disneyland is in neighboring Orange County, only about 30min southeast of downtown LA. If you prefer a nature hike in the desert, consider driving about 2h 5min east to arrive at Joshua Tree National Park. If you have much more time and want to mix up the hot weather with some cold weather skiing, consider driving to Lake Tahoe in Utah. It’s about 7h 30min away. Those driving in Los Angeles car rentals should be aware of a few road rules specific to Los Angeles. First, the freeways are quite large (up to six lanes) and busy (traffic jams are notorious), so to allow traffic to flow as smoothly as possible, it’s best to avoid the far-right lane unless you plan on taking a nearby exit. Also, make sure to give yourself enough time to get over to the correct lane before exiting. Secondly, most locals only honk for emergencies rather than frustration at the traffic. Lastly, the streets can change names even if you haven’t turned, so it’s best to use a GPS to avoid confusion. Get ready to explore the dazzling sights of Los Angeles on the road trip of a lifetime. When you rent a car on your vacation, you will enjoy the freedom of discovering each corner of the city at your own pace. Rather than relying on public transport, opt for a rental car to easily navigate this sprawling city. Don’t miss the beaches, never-ending boulevards, or the Hollywood Hills -- all easily reached by car. If you are flying into Los Angeles International Airport, you need to be aware that all the rental car companies are off-site. When you land, you will need to exit your terminal and use the courtesy shuttles. Your first option for your pickup is to go to the Lower/Arrivals Level islands outside baggage claim and wait by the "Rental Car Shuttles" sign. Alternatively, you can go to the LAX Shuttle Airline Connection and take a shuttle bus to the Remote Rental Car Depot. Driving in Los Angeles can be challenging due to the city’s infamous traffic. Therefore, as a visitor, you should look out for Carpool and High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes. You will be able to spot these designated lanes on most of LA’s freeways. Whilst HOV lanes are found on the far left, you can spot a Carpool lane from the diamond painted on the road. To use these lanes, you must have at least 2 people in the car. During weekdays, rush hour in Los Angeles starts between 5:00 am and 10:00 am. In the afternoon the roads are busy from 3:00 pm to 7:00 pm, although you should avoid driving on a Friday. You can also expect heavy traffic on weekend evenings, especially in or out of downtown and Hollywood. The best way to avoid traffic is to stick to driving through the connecting neighborhoods. Thankfully, the city is set out in a grid, so you have a variety of options for crossing town. 25% of our users found rental cars in Los Angeles for C$ 44 or less Book your rental car in Los Angeles at least 1 day before your trip in order to get a below-average price Compact rental cars in Los Angeles are around 24% cheaper than other car types, on average Los Angeles car rental experiences: the best tips from KAYAK users Insights shared by verified travelers who rented a car in Los Angeles Learn how KAYAK collects reviews and tips from users. Verified travelerNov. 2023 Driving from LAX to Anaheim and back is not a hard drive. There will be traffic in and out of LAX just leave yourself time. If you don’t need to take a turn off or exit for a number of miles /km stay in the middle lanes. If you have multiple people, get in the carpool lanes, just leave enough distance to get over to your exits (2miles/3.5km). Verified travelerOct. 2023 Choose high name brand rentals, like Budget or Hertz. The cost seems higher but will have better coverage, cars, and a smooth and quick process. Rental companies with lower prices will end up having more hidden fees and issues that will result in similarly priced rentals but with 10x the problems. Verified travelerNov. 2023 Ace rent a car was great! Be aware that they try to track additional fees and didn't show me the contract until after payment. I tried to cancel and they slashed the price by more than half. Verified travelerSep. 2023 Tolls, make sure you ask the rental company about tolls we didnt know were they were and cheaper if you pre pay Verified travelerSep. 2023 Get a toll pass and avoid a lot of traffic.

Verified travelerSep. 2023 Get a toll pass and avoid a lot of traffic. Verified travelerSep. 2023 Better cars and rental price SpencerSep. 2023 If your rental company is at the “remote rental car center,” be prepared for two separate bus/shuttle rides. First you take the metro bus to a parking lot station, then find your rental car company’s specific shuttle (if they are there). Verified travelerSep. 2023 Make sure you have some form of GPS as cell phones don't always work when there is fires. A paper map would help. Be alert when driving and don't speed. BryanOct. 2023 Stick with one of the big name companies that is at the central airport facility serviced by the airport shuttle.

Book in advance. Verified travelerNov. 2023 LOTS of traffic. Plan ahead. Verified travelerSep. 2023 Book online for better price. Do some research about the provided insurance cover to ensure this suits you. They try to sell the toll included for additional cost which is way higher than what you might have to pay in case of using a toll road. I travelled in 7 states and did not come across a single unavoidable toll road. Verified travelerOct. 2023 Make sure you use the major car rental agency when possible. Completely videotape the car when you’re taking it out check all your documentation because these little outfits try to scam you nickel dime all day long. It’s worth millions of dollars to them and commissions to the agents taking advantage of customers specially senior citizens is, a serious offense. Verified travelerAug. 2023 Coming from the East Coast, we were worried about the famous LA traffic and parking. In actuality, during our 5 night stay in West Hollywood, any where we drive to, the traffic wasn’t too bad. Meter parking & public parking garages were plentiful & reasonably priced. AbigailJul. 2023 There is a lot of traffic & it helps to have a passenger check your blind spots. Stay out of express lanes (as they are basically toll roads). Parking can be tight but just takes some extra looking around. Verified travelerJul. 2023 Rent from a higher end car rental company, not Ace. They’ll pick you up directly at the airport. The price may be more, but it will be such a better experience. MATTHEWJun. 2023 Be careful in certain areas for tolls roads. Try to book in advance and be a member who can walk to the car and not have to go into the office. Verified travelerJul. 2023 Don’t be in a rush, give yourself plenty of time.

Verified travelerJun. 2023 Driving in LA is fairly straight forward but not for the faint of heart, as it is very very busy, and people drive fast. Traffic congestion can change drive times very quickly, leading to unexpected delays, so try and allow lots of wiggle room for your plans. Verified travelerJul. 2023 Don't. Fly into another city. Just kidding, kind of. Know what your route will be and how to navigate heavy traffic. We didn't spend any time in LA, just headed up the coast and then over to the mountains. KaipoJul. 2023 Remember that when you book online, they typically tack on $200-$250 in a security deposit. Though you get it back in the end, the security deposit isn’t as high if you book straight through budget’s website. ClintJun. 2023 If you go to one of the cheap off airport, bargain companies, make sure that you read all the terms and conditions, and bring a copy of your insurance policy declarations page. Verified travelerAug. 2023 Driving in LA is fine. It helps to know which direction prevail g traffic will be going to avoid traffic jams. Try to limit driving and enjoy the spot you’re staying.

Wai Kin PeterAug. 2023 Traffic was really heavy during rush hour mornings and after work, avoid driving during these times. Congestion can cause 15-20 mins of delays from one destination to another. Pay attention to highways on summit and valley. Also, pay attention to the HOV lanes that required fast trek transponder as there will be hefty surcharge from car rental if you went inside HOV that requires that. You can set "avoid tolls" on your Google map. Verified travelerJul. 2023 Wait time was long to get the car, would be nice if there were more people checking people in. LaurieMay 2023 Rent directly through Budget - good prices, lines moved quickly and shuttle buses ran frequently. Great customer service.

LindseyMay 2023 You need one. Parking is plentiful and cheap. Verified travelerMay 2023 Do your proper research before renting. DelfinaMay 2023 Rent from a bigger company AndyMay 2023 Don’t let the rental companies up-sell toll passes unless you are sure you will need them. You probably won’t. LA drivers generally consider a turn signal as a an invitation to speed up into the space you want to move into. I learned to signal just before changing lanes. Many drivers in LA don’t signal at all. Verified travelerMay 2023 Use a reputable rental car agency like Budget, Hertz, etc. The cheaper options have a different shuttle lot and very bad communication. Beyond that they have hidden fees that ultimately bring the price up to the same or more than your average car rental place. The smaller agencies exist to take advantage of renters, especially visitors from abroad. FAQs about renting a car in Los Angeles What type of car is recommended for driving in Los Angeles?

That's exactly what I did (I returned it with ~190 miles of range, or 75% charge). Then they charged me $35 to charge the car up. I will be disputing the charge, but I should not have to waste my time doing this. 4.0 Mediocre Oct. 2023The staff was excellent. They tried to help us. I’m stuck with it until we found a solution.

My main issue was dropping off my car, I dropped it off around four or five in the morning and as I pulled in the man who was collecting everyone’s information and rental cars back completely skipped over me and my son. It was to the point that I just filmed the mileage on the car and the cars condition while walking away and telling him the keys were in the car. I had just driven FIVE hours in thanksgiving night and my flight was leaving in less than an hour!! I still had to catch the shuttle back and get through security. Thankfully I made it to my gate with about three minutes to spare before they closed the doors. Maybe serve people in the order that they arrive? 2.0 Poor Nov. 2023There was NOTHING good about this experience. It deserves zero stars! Booked a pick up truck last night, drove an hour from the valley to pick it up, my wife and I walk in and there are no other customers; the representative, Ashan has my paperwork on his desk and then tells me he doesn’t have a pickup for me. I asked why no one contacted me and he said they don’t offer that service. When I told him I thought that the service left a lot to be desired and that I'd be writing a review he got agitated and said; "Go ahead, I don't care, write a review, call the main office". I’ll be sticking with SIXT or any other rental company other than budget or Avis 2.0 Poor Nov. 202325 mins waiting for shuttle then 1hr 25mins before getting car. Completed Budget survey and at least got a good response from the Operations Manager. 4.0 Mediocre Nov. 2023It took over 2 hours to pick up the car. The line up was litterally about 150 people & the slow service was absolutely ridiculous. I had to stop & clen the interior of the windshield as it was so dirty you coulnd't see.

It is not where the other rental car pick shuttles are located. Once at the Westin, the line to check-in took forever and then I was rudely told they have no more cars in the class I reserved and blamed it on the third party vendors for over selling. I could either pay extra to get a car or they would cancel my reservation. The car was clean. The electronics in the car were a little sketchy. The car would connect and disconnect from apple car play constantly to the point where it was unsafe to use. Upon return I left my jacket in the car. I have called, texted, emailed. No response. Nu is impossible to get a hold of. Even when I had a question about pick up location and texted the number they suggested, 2 weeks later, still no response. I would never use this company again. 4.0 Mediocre Nov. 2023I liked the car and the quickness, friendliness, and easy of the workers in the garage who checked it out and in. The communications about how to get from airport to hotel were misleading and unhelpful. 1. Instructed to take shuttle from LAX to Westin hotel, I went to the "rental car shuttle" line outside the airport and waited well over a half hour while no NU Car shuttle came by. 2. Instructed by my printed rental confirmation to "call" an (818) # for assistance, I did. Got a recorded message that this number did not take call, only texts. 3. Text reply directed me (and at least a dozen other customers) to a different line to board a Metro bus that we could have been on much earlier. 4. Bus dropped us a remote lot to wait for a NU Car shuttle to hotel. Another long wait. 5. Two of the others with whom I was waiting (but not all of us) got a text that the pickup van or car was not working. 6. We all wound up hiking to the hotel. (relieved that none of us had more luggage than we could carry or tow, and that the weather was warm and dry) 10.0 Wonderful Nov. 2023I have zero complaints. Easy pick up. Car was great. 2.0 Poor Oct. 2023Better pick up service from the airport, had to take a transit but to a parking lot then be picked up by NU car rental van. They don't except phone calls for pick up it was all done through texting which was very slow. Had waived insurance but was added since I didn't have my insurance card for proof of coverage on rental. I didn't see that the insurance card was required in any of the documentation when we booked online. This added an extra $100.00 to our rental that we were not expecting. There were no places to park the vehicle when we returned it. We were not able to get in touch with anyone to get us a shuttle back to the airport. The hotel was kind enough to let us use their shuttle service to the airport at no charge. Will defiantly NOT be using priceline or NU Car Rentals for any future rentals we need. I still have not recieved any sort of correspondence from NU Car asking how our experience was. I have used Kayak previously and have been very happy with our experience. 10.0 Wonderful Jun. 2023Very easy pickup and drop off. Shuttle to and from airport is easy. Price is good. 2.0 Poor Mar. 2023Renting with NU Cars felt like renting with scammers. They treat you like they are hiding something when they cannot explain where the extra 160$ charge comes from. They called it „upgrade“ cost although I didnt ask for it and they gave me a lesser car. A Toyota instead of a Dodge Charger. If I hadnt been lucky with the key keeper guy I would have no choice but take the Toyota. When I protested and said that this is against my contract they just said well we can cancel you and good luck with finding a rental car now. Never again.

Cons:Don’t charge your customers more money than you should 2.0 Poor May 2021 Pros:The drop off was as difficult as they could make it. You had to take a bus to a parking lot and then they picked up in a van at the parking lot to take you to the rental office. Drop off was even worse, they are only open 8:00 Am to 6:00 PM. If you have a flight later in the day, you have to take the rental car to a over night parking lot and pay an extra 27.50 for that service. The thing they don't tell you is that in order to get into the parking lot you have to have a reservation with the parking lot. They don't tell you this and then your stuck with the car and not able to make it to your flight. Cons:Everything! This place is super shady and I would highly suggest removing them from KAYAK as they are not a good representative of what this booking company stands for. I have used KAYAK on numerous occasions and have always had a good experience. I was very upset that this type of company was an available option on this website.

We also happen to be 20 minutes late to our drop-off time, and they wanted to charge us a full day extra, which would have come at over $100+. This only got resolved after they called their manager and he waived that. - The cars brakes were worn down, so much so that it felt unsafe. The steering was pulling severely left and the car had close to 50'000 miles.

Because of timing I pre booked an Uber car to pick me up at 5:20 to hopefully get me back to the airport in time for my 7am flight. To my surprise the rental car location drop off was actually open despite what I was told on the phone. So I was able to return the car and get on a shuttle before 5am.

I received a prompt call from a very nice person after my complaint about my experience. I was refunded the extra $10.00 I had been charged to get me to the airport in time to catch my flight. Cons:Hidden charge - about $4.50 more than quoted by KAYAK. I had to pay $4+ for the inconvenience of waiting longer (they only run every 15 min) for a shuttle; than having to wait 15 mins for another pick up to take me to the car rental. The car was old and smelled. The carpeting was coming away from the floor. 6.0 Okay Apr. 2016 Pros:Price and the convenience of renting. No hassle and queues Cons:Car was not well maintained. Stains on seats. Smell of cigarette smoke 8.8 Very good Apr. 2016 Pros:The staff is amazing 2.8 Poor Apr. 2016 Cons:They mixed up my pick up time. I was scheduled to pick up my vehicle at 12 noon, they had me picking up at 2pm. She was adamant about this 2pm pick up time until I showed her my reservation on my phone. After this got worked out, she told me that they not only didn't have the vehicle I requested, they only had one vehicle on site- a gigantic minivan, which isn't ideal for city driving. When returning the vehicle they drop you off about a mile away from the shuttle because, in our driver's words "We don't pay to enter the parking lot" A mile walk carrying luggage at the end of the trip isn't how you want to end a trip. 2.8 Poor Apr. 2016 Pros:The price Cons:Got a very dirty car. My pickup appointment was delayed by half hour due to short staffing. When returning the vehicle, i was treated poorly by staff. They weren't attentive in any way. Received a discount but i had to prove the vehicle was dirty...soo glad i took a video. 4.4 Mediocre Apr. 2016 Cons:Took me over 40 minutes to get a car. First car I got had broken trunk lock. Instead of replacing this car, stuff starts to guide me how should I close this trunk. Overall, if you want cheap car, this is the place to go. If you want normal service, I wouldn't recommend this place. Eagle Rent A Car No score available yet 2 locations in Los Angeles Car rental locations Locations in Los Angeles 11860 S.

Luciana Bellini 13 June 2023 Los Angeles can be a famously tricky city to navigate when you first arrive. Without a comprehensive public transport system, getting around its multiple neighborhoods and seeing its many sights can be a challenge, especially seeing as this isn’t a city that people walk around – which is why the best option here is to rent a car as soon as you arrive. Driving around the city will make you feel like a real Angeleno, though be warned you may well spend much of your time behind the wheel stuck in traffic – LA is famous for its traffic jams, particularly during the morning and evening rush hours. If you can avoid those times, you’ll be fine to go cruising along the endless boulevards or driving along the beachfront, admiring the sparkling Pacific Ocean. Read on for everything you need to know about renting a car in the City of Angels.

Most rental companies are happy to accept international driving licenses as well as American ones, but it’s always worth double-checking the car rental terms as well. Each rental company has its own rules – some might not be willing to rent to drivers who haven’t held their driving license for 36 months or more, for example. If you’re traveling from overseas, you will also need to show a valid passport as proof of ID. You’ll also need a credit card so you can pay for the deposit on the car. Don’t have a credit card? Many major car hire agencies will accept debit cards, but some won’t, so it’s best to check in advance. Most car rental companies in LA don’t rent to drivers who are under 21, and many in the city require drivers to be 25 or older – those that rent to younger drivers will often charge higher rates, sometimes known as ‘young driver fees’. Types of cars available for rent in Los Angeles For the full California road trip experience, go for a convertible so you can feel the wind in your hair and the sun on your face as you drive up the Pacific Coast Highway. As a major city with multiple car rental companies, there are many different types of cars you can hire in Los Angeles. The type of car you choose depends on how far you’ll be traveling and how many of you there are. If you’re planning on taking day trips out of the city and spending a lot of time on the freeway, it might be worth investing in an SUV, for extra space and comfort on longer journeys. If you’re mainly planning on driving around the city, you could opt for a smaller car, especially as certain places feature designated parking spaces for compact cars. Where to get a rental car at Los Angeles International Airport If you’re flying into LAX, be aware that all of the car rental companies are off-site and can only be accessed via courtesy shuttles. These shuttles come frequently and are usually easy to find, though navigating your way through the busy airport can be a challenge. The same process can be repeated when you return the car, though make sure to leave plenty of time before your flight, as there can be long lines for drop off at the car rental companies. Car hire road trips in Los Angeles Due to its fairly limited public transit system, renting a car is a great way to get around LA and visit its neighboring cities. Some of the most popular shorter driving routes from the City of Angels include trips to San Diego (around a two-hour drive), Santa Barbara (around two hours), and Las Vegas (around four hours). Then there’s the famous California drive along the Pacific Coast Highway from Los Angeles to San Francisco, which takes around nine hours and includes many of the Golden State’s most famous sites, including Big Sur. It’s also possible to drive across the border into Mexico, with Tijuana just a two-hour drive away, but bear in mind you will need a valid passport to cross the border. You will also need to check with your rental company to determine if you are allowed to cross international borders. Everything you need to know about car insurance in Los Angeles You need to have car insurance to drive in Los Angeles, so make sure it’s included in your car rental agreement if you don’t have your own personal insurance. Every car rental agency will offer slightly different options when it comes to insurance, so make sure you read the policy thoroughly and get the right insurance to suit your needs. It could also be worth purchasing a Collision Damage Waiver or Loss Damage Waiver to make sure you’re protected if the car gets damaged. Things to know when renting a car in Los Angeles Though there are car hire companies dotted around the city, the largest concentration of them can be found at LAX, so it’s often the easiest option to pick up your hire car here before heading into the city (especially as this way you avoid having to pay the cab fare to get into LA). All the major car rental companies are here, so you have a wide variety of rental companies and cars to choose from. If you’re not arriving at LAX, there are still plenty of other places to hire cars in the city – ask about local options at your hotel, where they will be able to point you in the direction of the nearest car rental company. What you need to know about driving in Los Angeles Add a GPS to your rental car It could also be worth making sure your rental car has a GPS to navigate your way around LA, as the city’s freeways can be particularly confusing for first-time visitors. The City of Angels is infamous for its traffic, particularly during rush hour when the roads and freeways can get gridlocked. It’s best to avoid driving during this time if you can – on weekdays, rush hour usually runs between 6am-10am and 3.30pm-7pm. Fridays can also be particularly busy on the roads, with locals heading out of town for the weekend. If you’re planning on using the freeways in LA, look out for the Carpool and High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes. These are lanes that can only be used if there are two or more people in the car and can be a great way to save vital time and avoid congested lanes when driving on the freeway. Parking your rental car in Los Angeles Before renting your car, it’s worth checking whether the hotel you’re staying in offers free parking.Motels and cheaper hotels often offer free parking, while more upmarket establishments tend to charge extra. Streets in all the commercial areas of Los Angeles are metered, and it’s usually easy enough to find a spot. Many of the residential streets near these areas require parking permits, so make sure you always check the signs for local parking information before leaving your car. Fuel and gas stations in Los Angeles Since most people drive in LA, there’s no shortage of gas stations in the city, and all the big-name gas brands are represented. Most gas stations are self-serve, where you pump your own gas, and you can usually pay at the pump. There are around 4,500 public charging electric vehicle stations dotted around the city, making LA the most electric vehicle-friendly city in California. Of these, only around 550 are free charging stations. Motorists can expect to pay around 30 cents per kilowatt hour for level two charging and around 40 cents per kilowatt hour for direct current charging.
