For travelers looking at flights to Bangkok, Don Mueang International Airport (DMK) and Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK) are your two airport options. Don Mueang is a low-cost and regional hub, while Suvarnabhumi is the primary international hub. Suvarnabhumi Airport is connected directly to the downtown area by the Airport Rail Link (ARL). Visitors to Bangkok can easily go straight from the airport to central Bangkok with just a short trip on the train. The ARL also connects with the BTS Skytrain (Bangkok Mass Transit System), which is one of the major public transit arteries in Bangkok. Along with the BTS Skytrain, there are also metro lines (MRT) and bus lines (BRT) that connect to the ARL and service both airports. Besides the public transport options, taxis, tuk-tuks, and private vehicles are also available for hire outside of both airports. Tuk-tuks are certainly the more iconic travel option, but for Suvarnabhumi it is recommended that travelers stick to taxis, buses, or trains. However, at Don Mueang Airport, tuk-tuks are absolutely a great transport option for getting to your hotel. If your flight to Bangkok is just the first leg of your journey, then Don Mueang International Airport might be the better airport option. The Don Mueang Train Station is just a 10-minute walk from the airport, providing quick and convenient access to many of Thailand’s other great cities. Looking to hit the spa before you embark on your flight back at home? Suvarnabhumi Airport has an inhouse spa available just for that purpose.

I was impressed. Very eager to assist flight crew First time on Starlux. I was impressed. Very eager to assist flight crew Premium Economy on Starlux- a worthwhile way to cross the Pacific. This is a great premium economy experience. The seats are comfortable, wide and provide decent foot rests. The seatback TV is large, high resolution and plenty of content. Bluetooth connection for your headset and control from your phone is available. Food was decent and in line with the cabin class. The seat could be improved by providing more lower leg support especially for taller guests (6ft myself). Cabin crew will be moving up and down the aisle a lot since the galley is in front. Screen size was nice. No vent when hot, food was not good Wish plane type had more restrooms… Care and consideration from stewards and stewardesses was so great Pros: "The seats were comfortable, the plane was empty so could move for comfort" Cons: "The food was not very good, the airplane was empty, but assigned seats to fill rows while spouting nonsense about social distancing" Pros: "The crew and food was amazing, with ample entertainment selections." Cons: "Seats. For some unknown reason, JAL uses different seats on this 787-8 flight from NRT-SAN that's 2-3 inches less in pitch than all of their other planes. This was not comfortable on a 9-hour+ flight. The flight attendants also woke us up everytime food was served so we could recline up seats." Pros: "Crew was attentive and food was great. Japan air was a much better buy than any American company. I will look for Japan air for any flights I take in the future." Cons: "Nothing. The experience for international economy was perfect." Cons: "one crew member did not like her job, tossed the food to you, and was not pleasant like all the others." Pros: "JAL services on the plane is great. Food is much better than other companies. Ice Cream after dinner is great. Flight attendants are polite and nicer than other companies. Interior of the airplane was newer and comfortable." Cons: "N/A" Pros: "I really got a good deal on my trip's cost, and for the price, all the comforts of a top-quality airline were there. I especially appreciate how helpful and friendly the airline staff were." Cons: "The outbound flight still had the exact same movie selection as the inbound flight had, even though they were six weeks apart for my trip. I really feel like the movie selection should be changed every month (or even more frequently than that), as I ran out of films to watch." Pros: "Crew was courteous. Flight in general was uneventful which is a good thing." Cons: "Nothing to criticize. Flight experience was good but not exordinary." Pros: "Perfect in all aspects. Will use them again for all my flights." Pros: "Everything about this flight was awesome. The food, the people, the seats in economy felt like first class. VERY polite and happy attendants compared to American Airlines who seemed to be annoyed by those on the flight." Pros: "Kind and courteous staff" Cons: "A family with 2 kids making noisy and crying nonstop during the flight the father was playing Japanese video games with headphones on and very careless but once in a wile started yelling at Kiks because they distracted him from his entertainment. Grandma next to them was careless too,mother left the kids to father and was sitting 2 rows in the back and they never came at least to try to make them quiet even when the kids started to kik everywhere licluding the food tray and almost breaks it. Unfortunately the staff never came and try to talk to them about this issue Most of the people including several senior citizens looked angry and frustrated." Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "The seat, the food, the services, the boarding could have been better!" Pros: "Very friendly staff with excellent service. Bottled water in every seat upon boarding. Lots of leg room, and love the outer earphones they provide!" Cons: "More movie selections" Pros: "The crew was very friendly, and I was happy to be seated in a 2-person row." Cons: "Nothing the crew could do- a lot of turbulence and food served past midnight!" Pros: "Fortunately plane not full and was able to use adjacent seat(s)." Cons: "Let me change my ticket due to a death in the family." Pros: "Overall good, comfortable, nice and food and entertainment was very good quality." Cons: "I didn't realized we were on a code share flight from Seoul to Hanoi until we got to check in counter and they couldn't issue boarding pass even though it was a through check in for till Hanoi. In our booking itinerary it was printed as Korean air with a small print that said operated by jinair. It wasn't so bad but the hassle of going to another terminal to board and being in a smaller aircraft after a long flight wasn't the best." Pros: "Flight attendants were the friendliest and most patient I have ever experienced. Great customer service!!!" Cons: "Seats of any airplane could use improvement on comfort. But comfort was good." Pros: "Excellent service and probably the most efficient boarding process I’ve ever been a part of. Food service went by without a hitch, and the stewardesses knew English very well so we felt comfortable and welcomed. I also really liked being able to get terminal/travel information from the infotainment system. Being that I’ve never been to ICN or NRT before, having access to terminal maps and basic instructions on how to find connecting flights and baggage claim areas was probably one of the most helpful features of the flight!" Cons: "I am 5’11” and found my seat somewhat uncomfortable. It didn’t detract from being able to sleep at all, but it did seem like the seats on this airline might be at its most comfortable with shorter passengers." Pros: "The transit lounges at the new Seoul terminal are outstanding." Cons: "Flight delayed which caused me to miss my connecting. This is now causing me to spend an additional 12 hours traveling to the same destination." Airport lounge for business class is too crowded and not comfortable. Poor foods and facilities. Boarding was delayed. A lot of coughing people in the flight even in the business class, which indicated poor screening and health risks. It was a super smooth and comfortable flight even though I was in normal economy. The staff was so nice ☺️ Sleep pods in SilverKris lounge are disappointing, showers are great though. Food decent, not amazing. Need more toilets in lounge ideally. Flight was good but service can be better. Cleanliness Help for boarding and sitting Food should have been better Pros: "Singapore Airlines has everything worked out for you before you land. That's a great help. The stewardesses were just phenomenal and endlessly polite. I will definitely use them again." Cons: "As much as I normally nitpick something, I literally have no criticism at all of Singapore Airlines. Everything they did was a step above everyone else." Pros: "Crews were great. Seats space could be better ... overall caring & attentiveness of crew members make a lot of difference." Cons: "Food! 40 years ago Singapore Airlines was second to none in my book! Now I feel like I was away somewhere and Singapore Airlines has changed dramatically....Must be a lot of moving pieces have changed that I was wondering again during my journey whether I was really flying Singapore Airlines..." Pros: "Crew was super nice and the food was good (for plane food)! Really appreciated that they had snacks and chocolate on hand for hungry passengers throughout the flight. A 17 hour plane ride is never the best, but Singapore Air made it as pleasant as possible. Also, we booked on Kayak and was routed through a third party vendor JustFly, which I was a little worried about - but our booking went off without a hitch." Cons: "Rather long wait at business check-in, friendliness there ok, on board service slow with the champagne, old aircraft with old configuration of seats, nothing really bad, but it's not like this that you win an airline of the year award!" Pros: "I liked that on the longest leg of my trip - I had an entire row to myself to stretch out. Im old, things like that are important...along with compression socks...haha!" Cons: "I think the food - I dont know exactly what, because we're on a plane - but I think it could be a bit more appealing? More greens, colors? Not sure, but it was okay." Cons: "Flight was a little warm but was able to get it cooler via help from crew but got warmer again towards the end of flight. Overall good flight though" Cons: "The planes are pretty outdated especially the connecting flights from Narita to HKG" Pros: "Excellent service from the cabin crew." Cons: "The Japanese (Washoku) breakfast was not as good as I expected." Pros: "New plane or so it seemed. Crew very attentive to needs. Nice entertainment system with large screen." Pros: "The crew was great, friendly and helpful. The food was good and the overall service on the plane was great." Cons: "Our flight was delayed from Los Angeles and we did not make our connecting flight in Tokyo. The next option they had was a full 24 hours later so we ended up taking the train. I tried to make adjustments to one of my flights for the return home and was told that is not an option." Pros: "They were very helpful in changing my seat to an aisle seat. The first meal was rather mediocre. The second one was good. The seats were spacious and comfortable and I did not feel claustrophobic." Cons: "They were very helpful in changing my seat to an aisle seat. The first meal was rather mediocre. The second one was good. The seats were spacious and comfortable and I did not feel claustrophobic." Pros: "The cabin crews were excellent. Food was delicious. Lots of leg room in Economy class. Overall had a great experience" Cons: "none" Pros: "Crew was amazing and very comfortable seat" Cons: "Food can be better and Entertainment was poor There should be more choices available. WiFi was spotty only 150 MB was available after paying. It should be free in business class like other airlines" Pros: "Polite, attentive, and amiable staff show they take pride in their top notch service. Entertainment options (movies, documentaries, travel guides) on screen are also a huge plus." Pros: "The flight was late checking in. The staff handled the situation well and kept the passengers informed." Pros: "Very comfortable flights. Exceptional crew on and off the planes. Great food and drink/snack options.
