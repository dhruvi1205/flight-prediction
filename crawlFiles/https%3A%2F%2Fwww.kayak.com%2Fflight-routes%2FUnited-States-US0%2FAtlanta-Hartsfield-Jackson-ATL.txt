Cons: "One of the people with a crying baby in the seat behind me decided to sit in the seat next to me. I just wanted to sleep. It was a miserable experience for me." Pros: "I almost got a chance to sleep." Cons: "One of the people with a crying baby in the seat behind me decided to sit in the seat next to me. I just wanted to sleep. It was a miserable experience for me." Pros: "The crew was great and the flight was OK...there were some bumps along the way." Cons: "The seat could have been a bit more comfortable." Cons: "Nothing. Smooth flight, friendly crew, and early arrival. Can’t be beat!" Cons: "We sat at the gate for nearly 2 1/2 hours after boarding flight Atlanta to Orlando! Very poor explanation and it was very hot on the airplane!" Pros: "The seating was a lot more spacious than on the Delta flight we took to Portugal three weeks ago." Cons: "The gate agent got the boarding group messages mixed up on the display screens, which allowed some people with C boarding numbers to board with the first group of As, but aside from that minor issue everything went fine (it was a full flight, and too many people carried on luggage, as usual)." Cons: "Love Southwest, never had delays and the staff are very friendly" Pros: "The crew got us situated and ready to take off very quickly to make up for a slow start!" Pros: "Crew was funny and had a sense of humor, especially regarding the safety instructions." Cons: "Free Wifi. Paying for it is silly as ticket prices are expensive anyways." Cons: "No WiFi and no one notified us we were delayed." Pros: "The crew was attentive." Cons: "No phone chargers on the plane. WiFi was not available for that particular flight. We sat on the plane at the gate for almost an hour before the plane started moving and the crew said the delays were due to “paperwork”" Pros: "The seat was nice." Cons: "Offered water or Orange juice in a can due to a short flight. I may recommend no canned orange juice, due to the quality ingredients and something more freshly squeezed for health benefits. And offers coffee or tea." Pros: "Good crew, did a good job making us feel good for a delayed late night flight." Cons: "For some reason air was never turned on. Air only seemed to flow once we were moving but sitting at the gate and once back on the ground taxing it got very hot again." Cons: "No seat-back entertainment on a long flight is not ok. If there was warning about that during the booking process, it was too subtle and I missed it. It was an unpleasant surprise. Also, the seats are just so stiff and uncomfortable. If this was a 3-hour flight, fine. But nearly 6 hours, no." Pros: "Comfortable seats and smooth red-eye transcontinental flight." Cons: "If there weren't a 15-minute delay due to maintenance." Pros: "Even though I was in Group C, I was one of the first to board (Groups A, B, and C were called to board all at once). Since the gate agent said the flight was full and there would be limited space for carry-on bags, being one of the first on the plane was nice. The leg room (I'm 6'2") was good." Cons: "The crew only did one pass through the cabin with soft drinks. Perhaps because it was a red-eye? Anyway, on a nearly 5 hour flight, I would have liked more than one small cup of refreshment." Pros: "The two member of the crew were very welcoming and kept a very good sense of professionalism along with adjustments to every passenger. I can consider myself a frequent flyer and it’s relieving to have a crew like that." Cons: "I would appreciate a quicker and just a little bit more organized check in and maybe some different snacks that will make an airline stand out." Pros: "Crew was amazing." Cons: "Seats are probably the most uncomfortable I’ve ever sat on." Cons: "Delay on takeoff and a delay on arrival. Flight Attendants never offered headphones for purchase to watch in filght movie/TV." Pros: "Super easy boarding and friendly staff." Cons: "I am 5'11 and my legs were literally touching the seat in front of me the whole time." Pros: "The only enjoyable thing about my flight was the couple sitting next to me." Cons: "We weren’t served drinks until nearly 2 hours in. They kept making announcements saying “it’s really turbulent and not safe” but I’ve flown a lot and we barely had any turbulence the entire flight and at no point was it unsafe. When it was calm they were hanging out and taking in the back." Pros: "The flight was smooth and on time. The crew members were very nice and helpful" Cons: "JetBlue is the best" Pros: "Jet blue flights seem generally good. Like the WiFi access to be Able to use flight time efficiently." Pros: "Crew was excellent. Boarding was great." Cons: "I had significant delays on both the flight to Logan & the flight back to Charlotte." Cons: "My luggage was torn and half of my stuff is missing from my bag" Pros: "Crew was amazing. It was the pilot’s last flight before retirement, so it was fun celebrating with him and the crew. Seats were comfortable." Pros: "Crew was courteous and gave constant updates in regards to any delays." Cons: "Flight was delayed and there was congestion prior to take off. Not sure there was anything that could’ve been done." Pros: "Crew was nice and accommodating. Plenty of leg room in regular cabin. Good entertainment options.?" Pros: "Comfortable seating with lots of legroom; clean; ease of boarding and de-boarding; on time; nice variety of entertainment available ; everything was timely!" Cons: "Some of the channels on the direct tv were not available throughout the whole flight; one flight attendant was not very friendly (she wasn’t rude either)." Cons: "Flight was 3 1/2 hours delayed. In-flight entertainment system didn’t function. They didn’t perform a beverage/snack service. Very poor overall. Disappointing." Cons: "JetBlue's livery is really beginning to show its age. The entertainment screens flicker and flash and the once-luxurious leather seats appear worn. The crew is still great, as usual, and our flight in general was excellent." Highly recommend. If you do not have Global Entry avoid BYC Kennedy! Horrible ground experience for immigration, luggage transfer and to connect to next flight with boarding card ready! Average wait standing in lines 2 hours! So 1900s security facilities in NYC Kennedy!! Delta airlines charge $ 30,oo US DOLLARS for the check in for a suitcase in the baggage hold Cons: "Given we left at 7:15 am, I would’ve liked some food options instead of biscuits and peanuts" Cons: "The crew was overly aggressive with mask policy enforcement. They patrolled the aisles and routine pointed at passengers directing them in a hostile manner to keep their masks on their faces, even when they were trying to eat or drink. They also threatened customers by stating it was a federal law several times. It was very uncomfortable to say the least. I will not fly delta again by choice." Pros: "I had heard about limited food options during covid flights but everything was tasty and generous. I always appreciate it when my initial flight books my check-in to my final stop and gives me all my boarding passes at once and Delta did just that. They were also really good at communicating updates like changes to the gate." Cons: "People should just be prepared to be asked more questions than usual. It can definitely make you feel nervous but just remember that the new covid restrictions are stressful for flight staff just as much as they are stressful for you. Be cooperative and honest and you shouldn't have any problems." Pros: "Delta flight took extra precaution to keep all passengers safe before during and after the flight. They communicate effectively during the flight. I will be flying Delta again and again." Cons: "The trip was great" Pros: "crew was fine" Cons: "terrible space/legroom. Very cramped tray table, couldn't fit laptop on it. Made me check my carry on bag. not even gate check, checked to baggage claim. Yet there was still overhead space once I got on. Lots of . overbooking - should never happen in this day and age. Delta does not deserve its "#1" rating. The rating system seems biased. Probably paid off by delta. Southwest is way better for economy class." Pros: "The crew was fantastic. The seats were very comfortable and the entertainment screen functioned perfectly with a great selection of things to watch." Cons: "The boarding process seems slightly longer for delta than other airlines. I figure you’re aware of this and are working on streamlining this. Further while the safety animation yo have made is cute is a little confusing at times." Pros: "Crew was good. As always not enough leg room if you are taller. Resent having to pay extra for more leg room." Pros: "Delta crew is always great." Cons: "You need to update ALL of your planes to have charging at EVERY seat, not just the passengers in comfort plus or better. It’s 2019. We ALL have devices." Flight late …60 minutes No food No wifi No entertainment system A disaster!!! Long lines to board with only two staff checking boarding passes! Pros: "Full flight, so the usual boarding slowness, but the ground and flight crews were very good and made things easy." Cons: "Boarding. But that’s the reality of travel these days." Pros: "Flight was cramped and plane was small, but the crew were nice." Pros: "The crew was very nice" Cons: "The planes look old, cheap and the seats are super tiny and cramped" Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "Everything, this is the fist and last time we flight with you guys, flight delayed, my husband was not in the system, lost connection, and in our way back same thing, worse experience ever" Pros: "The Westjet app took forever to download on my phone AND my husband was unable to download it ... made for a long flight without entertainment. Also, the crew didn’t come off welcoming or inviting." Pros: "Hated everything 10 hrs delay in flight and no assisstance provided by ground staff. Not recommended" Cons: "Approachable Staff" Pros: "The crew was amazing. The seats were comfortable." Cons: "The thermal control in the waiting area of the pearson airport before boarding was uncomfortable."
