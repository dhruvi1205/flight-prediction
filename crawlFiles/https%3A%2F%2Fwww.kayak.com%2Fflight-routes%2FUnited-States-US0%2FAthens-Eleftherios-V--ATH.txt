I will never fly emirates again" Pros: "Plane was modern and more comfortable than most" Cons: "I do understand that it was an overnight flight but the crew came around only during meals and at no other time did they check on us. I hit the call button and nobody came - call button just went off. I was in the middle next to a sleeping passenger and could not get up." Pros: "Crew was amazing." Cons: "Seats were a little narrow and could use new cushions." Pros: "The food was good. The crew was very accommodating." Cons: ".If the seats recline to just a little bit more" Pros: "The crew was great and the dinner was really good!" Cons: "Breakfast could have been better and the seat was pretty uncomfortable" Pros: "Timing of flight" Cons: "Baggage policy has changed and has become too restrictive. Wieight and size and number of checked baggage is below competitors for transatlantic flights. Same for cabin luggage and is enforced randomly. Some economy passers were allowed two pieces, others were forced to check in cabiuggahe at $200." Pros: "The crew was fantastic. The food was good for airline food." Cons: "The seats were narrow and seemed a bit smaller than usual." Pros: "They were very courteous and provided us with a solution with an overweight luggage so that we wouldn’t pay the extra fees. Flight was very smooth on the 777. Best flight ever." Cons: "Nothing negative about this flight." Pros: "The cabin, the variety of beverages and the time of the trip" Cons: "Perhaps the strange breakfast and the TVs quality" Pros: "The boarding was efficient." Cons: "There were no vegetarian or vegan food options. The flight was crowded and uncomfortable." Cons: "I fell sick and my doctor advised against flying. Tried calling Swiss Air and JustFly.com: 6 calls back and forth and 7 hours on hold, no help. Finally got advised on driving to the airport to make the flight change at the Swiss Air counter at O’Hare. The representative told me to bring a note from doctor to switch flights. I did the next day. The same representative looked me in the eye after advising the day before and said there’s nothing she could do. Why make an elderly sick person drive to the airport again if you know already you cannot help??Absolutely terrible experience, no help from the airline or travel agency. Total loss of the full price of the ticket." Pros: "Entertainment" Cons: "I requested a vegan vegetarian meal and did not get it. I had to do with the regular meal which had a lot of dairy products to which I am allergic to. The space between rows of seats. It was really crammed in Economy and we are a petite thin family!"

Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "Entertainment didn’t work, the crew did nothing to help. The plane was hot and stuffy. My luggage is lost." Pros: "The crew service was very good, as was the food.

Pros: "Everything was amazing, except for 2 pieces of luggage that got lost, misplaced, from Zurich to Chicago" Cons: "2 luggage missing, I was told by Swiss airlines I would get them the next day, because they were left behind in Zurich." Cons: "We were packed like sardines! My flight made me want to retire from traveling!" Pros: "Movies" Cons: "Crew was rude to passengers. One passenger asked for extra bread and crew arrogantly commented , we dont give but ok take one." Pros: "The crew was really great and helpful" Cons: "Only thing that could have been better was ginger ale." Seats need to be updated. Allowance needs to be made for dinner service at an alternative time The crew should demonstrate flexibility by moving a screaming infant to its own seat with 1 parent Pros: "I like that there are multiple bathrooms onboard." Cons: "The rows are so narrow between seats that your roll on suitcase will not fit. You have no elbow room in your seat. People who live in England are very rude and would not let those of us seated in front of them to deplane. Too bad there isn’t someway to make people wait their turn." Pros: "I travelled on economy delight, flight was fully packed, yet it felt spacious and comfortable. Lightning was great. Food was yummy! And pilots gave us updates on air travel, and if there were any delays etc." Cons: "Nothing. Had a great trip!" Pros: "The seating in upper class is unconventional and uncomfortable." Cons: "Reconfigure seating in upper class. We will no longer be customers for that reason alone.." Cons: "We are a little hard of hearing. It was hard to hear the attendant when giving directions over the intercom. The speech was garbled and directions spoken too fast. I am not referring to the safety speech. Recommend slowing down so that we have more time to process what was spoken." Pros: "Decent crew, nice snacks." Cons: "Wifi shonky - didn’t work most of the way. Entertainment app didn’t work. Lengthy delay." Cons: "Staff were unhelpful and ran out of many food items by the time we were served - meaning that there wasn’t anything available for us to eat as we don’t eat eggs. The check-in was stressful and staff were keen to help - unprofessional and unsatisfactory." Pros: "Crew was nice" Cons: "Screens have poor color quality Seat too small Legroom cut into by electronics box Row 45 next to bathroom and no windows" Pros: "Loads of leg room compared with other flights (I'm 6' and my knees are usually embedded in the seat in front, but not this time!" Cons: "USB socket on the entertainment on both flight out and return was broken." Delta airlines charge $ 30,oo US DOLLARS for the check in for a suitcase in the baggage hold Cons: "The crew was overly aggressive with mask policy enforcement. They patrolled the aisles and routine pointed at passengers directing them in a hostile manner to keep their masks on their faces, even when they were trying to eat or drink. They also threatened customers by stating it was a federal law several times. It was very uncomfortable to say the least. I will not fly delta again by choice." Pros: "Kosher snacks! Thank you. Screens and outlets at every seat. Safe, controlled Covid protocols including de-boarding. Excellent!" Pros: "Delta flight took extra precaution to keep all passengers safe before during and after the flight. They communicate effectively during the flight. I will be flying Delta again and again." Cons: "The trip was great" Cons: "We arrived around 39 minutes early and the whole process was very smooth" Pros: "Crew was friendly and engaging" Cons: "I wiped down my seat area to clean it. It would be nice to know what Delta is doing as well."

Cons: "Gates switched 3 times and all bags had to be checked because of a small aging plane." Cons: "I would ask that the gate does not share in detail reason for delay in seat assignment is related to getting a family sitting together when the basic rules should apply unilaterally." Pros: "Got to my destination without any issues" Cons: "Seats/seating area are too small, and I'm not a big person." We had a flight from Ny to ist and ist to Athens. Our flight was landed late to the Istanbul due to weather conditions and we couldn’t make the next flight to Athens. Turkish airlines transferred us to Aegen airlines for our ist to ath flights and told us they will transfer our luggages. However when we arrived Athens there was no luggage’s and I was traveling with two little kids. This was horrible experiences. Our ath flights was also early morning and we had to wait until 5pm for the next flight with two kids at the airport and they haven’t provided any hotel or food to us. We paid hotel with our own expense and also for food. That’s was horrible experience. I am very disappointed. Business class seats were not comfortable. I have traveled with Turkish Airlines several times and it’s always late. My suitcase was lost. I was in another country and I had to find my way to go back to airport and get my suitcase since it arrived next day after my flight. Really disappointed. It was a quick flight, and it was fine. The only thing was my seats wouldn’t recline because I was in the last row. It was a 1am flight so that made it hard to sleep. But otherwise it was fine. Pros: "i like the food and movie choices." Cons: "Crew was little bit rude. They didn’t help me to find the spot for my carry on luggage." Pros: "Another fantastic trip with Turkish Airlines. Everything from their membership in Star Alliance, to their awesome customer service, to their fantastic tasting food." Pros: "Food was great! Crew was excellent and I loved entertainment choices!" Pros: "The staff member who checked me in was very friendly" Cons: "the inflight staff needs to improve their behaviour in dealing with passengers. Some were quite rude. The aircraft seats were extremely cramped. The food selection was quite poor." Cons: "Seats are very comfortable! Very nice flight, crew, entertainment screens are large," Pros: "We were told by terminal staff in Istanbul that the fkught was on Turkish Airlines.We waited in line at the first ticket counter and then we were sent to a second ticket counter where we waited in line again. We were sent to a 3rd counter where the Supervisor was chatting with a lady for 20 minutes. When we reached the counter we were told it was too late to board and we had missed our flight even though there were still 35 minutes to flight time. Turkish Airlines staff would not help us any further and we had to go purchase another ticket." Pros: "We arrived in Athens eventually" Cons: "People were made to wait outside in the cold airport bus for half an hour. The ground crew gave no explanation for the delay. After heavy protests, they let the waiting passengers back into the terminal.
