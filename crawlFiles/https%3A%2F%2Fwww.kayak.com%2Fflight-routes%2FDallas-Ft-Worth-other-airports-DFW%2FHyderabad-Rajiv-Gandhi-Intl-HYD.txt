And the thing from dubai to Hyderabad one of the attendants doesn't even help with the luggage, don't close the top shelf behaved as if untounchavility prevailed which Is very bad" Cons: "Everything!! My seat was not extra wide, it was broke and would not recline...14hr flight!! Entertainment system didn’t work right." Pros: "Crew was great" Cons: "The seats were pretty stiff compared to the A380 business class seats on my preceding flight."

Cons: "Qatar airways allowed us to take both separately and we could take up exit row if available without payment" Cons: "A 15 hour noisy flight. Careless mothers and their screaming kids. No Manors on telling them to be quiet or stop screaming. They played with their kids in an awfully loud sound." Pros: "nothing" Cons: "- We were made to sit in flight for 2 hours. Then all were offloaded. - We were made to sit on airport for flight for about 6 hours. - I was not allowed to exit or reschedule the flight until i waited for 6 hours. - Still its not confirmed whether the flight will depart on given time. - I missed my important work in India. - The new flight arrives Mumbai midnight 2:30 am which is very hectic for me.

Request was denied and put in a red eye flight for next day. Pathetic Airlines" Pros: "Crew is great and on their game" Cons: "Stuck next to and surrounded by crying babies on a long haul flight is terrible. So uncomfortable! Wish I could afford to upgrade but I suppose I must tough it out:/" Pros: "Everything other than food" Cons: "While they gave good AVML food on DXB-HYD flight, not sure what stops them from repeating it on SFO-DXB flight., It was worst to the end." No attention paid to passengers asking for simple things such as water. Only 2 meals throughout a 16-hour flight. Crew Needs to pay better attention to flight attendant call buttons. Food, entertainment and blankets are minimum requirements for an international flight with a duration of 3+ hrs. None was in this flight and very dirty bathrooms on the top of it.

By the end of the flight there was hardly any jews laughed and no Lamons. The plane was not ready to be full Of people." Pros: "They are professional all the way.

I also like the entertainment service. I was able to watch the live TV news to keep me update." Cons: "I didn't like the food. It's taste sour. The foods needs improvement." Cons: "5 layers of security check for us bound flights. Group A, B, C & D almost boarded on the same time. Food was horrible." Pros: "The crew is always very friendly and helpful. Plenty of space in the overhead bins." Cons: "The seats are cramped just like any airline." Pros: "Service was very good, an excellent selection of entertainment to stay distracted during the 13 hour flight, and a reasonable rate for the flight." There were no entertainment from Germany to Delhi flight. Very limited option for previous flight. Ear piece was loose and kept coming off. Seats were comparatively smaller. Food could have been tastier. Missed salt and pepper on the side. Yogurt can be added to the meal. What made the trip terrible, is the fact that we were delayed in Chicago that caused us to miss our flight from Frankfurt to Nuremberg. we ended at the airport for an extra 8-9 hours. The only thing Lufthansa did, was gave us a 15 euro voucher for food. That is an insult, plus two people for almost 9 hour? 15 euro does not cover anything for two people for two meals. If my transfer flight wasn’t cancelled and my luggage wasn’t sent to Milan The flight attendants were quite abrupt with answers to legitimate questions. The flight was okay, i.e., the flight was smooth, Pros: "Seats were too cramped up, legroom was a problem. A device was under the seat was cramping the leg room. The entertainment selection was very very poor for a long flight." Cons: "Better entertainment selection." Pros: "Seats were good." Cons: "Frankfurt airport was bad. Too hot and poor organization. There was no place to sit and we were not allowed to go to the gate where sitting place was available." Pros: "Service on the DFW-->FRA leg was phenomenal (ratio of attendants to fliers). Food was delicious and seats very comfortable." Cons: "Boarding process and organization could have been a bit better in communicating access and groups. Not super critical, but the goal in in process is to be as efficient as possible." Pros: "Lufthansa is a friendly airline but was unable to help with our problem because I had booked through Kayak." Cons: "When I presented my passport at the counter to receive my boarding pass, I was told my passport needed to be over 3 months before expiration. It expires January 14, 2019. It is not written on the passport, nor mentioned during booking. I’ve been to Latvia four times previously and never heard this requirement. I cancelled the flight with Lufthansa who said I must call Kayak who gave me another number to call and that number then sent an email that said there was a $350 rebooking fee for each ticket, IF they decided I was eligible for rebooking. Yes, we got a great rate, but looks like wasted $ now. I will book directly with the airline in the future to ensure the ability to rebook." Cons: "I get Emergency to be sick and be in hospital and the request company for exchange my fly back from Slovakia back to my country USA and they declined my refund or exchange tickets even if I have doctors statement being in the hospital they’re rude and mean and decline make any changes for me" Cons: "So there was a 2 hours delay in Dallas which resulted in 11 hours delay in Frankfurt .. this trip was horrible how did they dare do that to the passengers.. they should have gotten us a place to rest but we were left on the chairs in the airport.. will never fly Lufthansa anymore" The boarding at Heathrow is chaotic. That's partly due to the lack of space and seating at gate 8, and a Qatar flight from gate 9 at the same time. That's down to Heathrow rather than Gulf Air. I've had a similar experience here before. Another problem which isn't specific to Gulf Air or Heathrow is announcements, and those for boarding in particular. They are difficult to hear with all the other noise and for me with hearing problems it's even worse. A simple tv screen would help, so long as it's updated of course. Few people on the plane - Was great! The plane was late to board and over an hour late to arrive. They said it was airport control. How can these things not be booked it advance? Very frustrating! New aircraft, new and modern. Crew could be a little more smiling. Greeting BH International Airport, Flight No. GF-2101 From Bahrain to Dammam At 1:35 am. to 2:20 am. Booking reference: WFYQEG I was informed that I will receive my baggage in Dammam Airport, later on I arrived in Dammam and I didn’t get my baggage, they claimed due to my friend Mr. Faisal didn’t show because he left the Airport and drive his own car all the way to Dammam. OK, I get it and I totally respect the system when you don’t show up your baggage get dropped from the flight, but it’s not my fault when i stay in Bahrain Airport waiting for my next flight around 5 hours then once i get to Dammam I don’t receive my baggage, because my friend who’s didn’t show up his baggage was arrived to Dammam airport, and i’m the one who deserve to get his own baggage didn’t receive anything.

Kind regards, Mohammed Sent from my iPhone Pros: "Good evening, this is Sarah Al-Makhlouf. I booked a ticket from your website, but it happened to me a great deal. My ticket was from Riyadh to Bahrain, but when I went to the airport, I could not get on the plane, and the reason was that the flight was going to Dubai, not to Bahrain. Is there any solution to this issue, And where is my money? I will send you the ticket in the e-mail, and at the airport they said that it is not strange on your site that the traveler falls into this problem, how can you sell tickets to a particular destination without making sure, who bears the responsibility now?"

Pros: "Once we were in the air (see below), everything was very good." Cons: "Poor organisation at the airport (maybe notGulfAir's fault). Flight slightly delayed. Gate changed at last minute, board said "Boarding now", but we then waited something like 30 minutes at the new gate to actually start boarding." Pros: "Business class was really enjoyable with a flat bed. Food was delicious and served with a smile. Crew was helpful and easy to talk to." Cons: "Entertainment and selection of movies could be improved. The Hollywood movies did not work, others did." Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "Economy sets are too tight and cramped. Cup holder was good for nothing, i tried to put my soft drink bottle in it and it slipped right out the bottom and when I tried to put a cup of water in it supplied by the crew it wouldn't fit! When I reclined my seat to sleep the passenger behind me pushed my seat hard back to upright position. When I turned around to ask why the rude response I realized that he was a tall fellow and his knees were already touching the back of my seat so when I reclined it, it hurt him and he had no where to move his legs. I couldn't do or say much as I understood his misery and therefore kept my seat up the whole way for 5 hours! The flight was full and neither of us could relocate to another seat." Pros: "Hey dear I don’t come by flight I got issue and I used car trip to Riyadh in 18/4/2019" Cons: "They canceled the flight that I booked from muscat to Manama at 1245 and booked to me at 745 am flight, and they keep me waiting for six hours to catch my flight from Manama to Riyadh, They did not offer me a hotel to stay during the waiting period."
