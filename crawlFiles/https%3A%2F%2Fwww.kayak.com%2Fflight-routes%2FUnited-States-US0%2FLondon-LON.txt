Missed connecting train since flight was late into Zurich and I had to stay at airport hotel because of it as well as I had to repurchase train ticket Cons: "Too much nonsense with carry on and check in language. I paid for my seat but they changed it for better balance of the plain. Really I weigh 165 lbs. Once the plane reaches altitude they let me take my seat. However the plane was barely occupied and somebody with closer and took my seat." Pros: "Entertainment" Cons: "I requested a vegan vegetarian meal and did not get it. I had to do with the regular meal which had a lot of dairy products to which I am allergic to. The space between rows of seats. It was really crammed in Economy and we are a petite thin family!"

Very comfortable seat" Cons: "Everything was great" Pros: "Crew was great !!!" Cons: "Seating in upper class is uncomfortable and bedding is not fresh." Cons: "We are a little hard of hearing. It was hard to hear the attendant when giving directions over the intercom. The speech was garbled and directions spoken too fast. I am not referring to the safety speech. Recommend slowing down so that we have more time to process what was spoken." Pros: "Crew was great. Flight was on time and crew helped the boarding process go smoothly. It was nice to get a beer or wine at no additional cost." Cons: "Seat was shockingly small, even for economy class. TV was poor quality." Cons: "I cancelled this flight online, then I called to let them know I was getting emails, but that I had cancelled. For two days I received emails about delayed flights and now this." Pros: "The crew were very attentive, they tried hard to help me with comfort, drinks etc. I didnt have food as it was so good in the Virgin Clubhouse!" Cons: "The bed! When you flip it flat its rock hard, and the matress they provide is useless! Need foam matress to really make it more comfotable. If the seat reclined another few inches i wouldnt bother flipping it." Flight was cancelled after 3 1/2 hours. Support for rebooking was overwhelmed. Lost first class tickets and to fly economy. Pros: "The crew was great. The pilots too." Cons: "The audio and video at my seat did not work correctly." Cons: "Nothing, really. Airlines unfortunately can’t make people patient or polite, & I can’t afford a private jet, so I’ll have to settle for an eye roll or twelve." Pros: "Crew, food, flight." Cons: "Could always use a wider seat. I just hate having my hips touching a stranger for the whole trip." Cons: "Plane was late taking off. Crew did not provide water when requested. They were busy with beverages that they could sell at a cost." Cons: "They were delayed. They wouldn't let us keep our checked sized bags which slowed us down even more. Our next flight left without us while we were waiting for a gate to open so we could get off the plane. There were no more flights so we had to fly to an alternate city and rent a car to get home."

Cons: "I think it makes a huge difference when the crew says something comforting before or during turbulence instead of just “buckle seat belts” it’s so simple yet goes so far is soothing anxiety but we got “BUCKLE SEAT BELTS” like wow" Pros: "decent comfort on board" Cons: "both flights delayed, some rude crew, and Avianca lost my luggage when I got to Medellin" Pros: "The movie selection for children and adults was fine. The peach juice was good too." Cons: "The food was absolutely the most disgusting plane food I’ve had. I mean, airplane meals aren’t ever really that great but this was particularly foul. Also they should really stock the seat pockets with the nausea bags especially with all the turbulence over the Andes." Pros: "The crew was accommodating" Cons: "The seats were uncomfortable and they changed my flight 3 times" Cons: "Seats are to small and food was overall not to par" Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "Having to leave airport after waiting hours for a repair" Pros: "Great service gave my brother all the attention he needed" Pros: "The plane and it was in time. I could sleep" Pros: "Pretty much on time. Entertainment options were great. Clean enough." Cons: "Food was not very good. Extremely salty. Our family of 4 did not eat much of it." Cons: "A rating of one start is too much for this airline. Avianca caused me to miss my flight in LAX, refused to help me reach my ultimate destination for which I paid them hundreds of dollars to do, nor did they offer to credit my losses for which they were responsible. Customer Service was as useless as the individuals in person that I dealt with. I never made it to my destination because I was forced to return home to San Francisco, unable to see my wife-to-be in Brasil. I will never fly with this airline again."
