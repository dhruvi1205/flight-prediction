Pros: "The crew did a wonderful job of anticipating needs and having all the little ammenities you could want."

They moved passengers to the Lufthansa but didn’t tell us even though we checked with the counter every 20 min. Apparently a text went out that we didn’t get" Pros: "Crew was very helpful and courteous Entertainment system was pretty good Food was good. They could have given water bottles instead of asking for water." Cons: "Seat comfort in Economy was just ok. Since this was a long haul flight, seats could have been better." Pros: "Excellent customer service, helpful staff" Cons: "Food was unpalatable - HNML. Needs to be improved, the beans in a tomato sauce looked like a tin of dice tomatoes was poured over the boiled beans. Chicken curry didn’t taste good either as it was over cooked. Didn’t relish the vermicelli dessert or the salmon. Thanks for the roll & lactose free butter, the cheese and biscuits" Pros: "In-flight entertainment choices." Cons: "It was a long flight, frequent offers of snacks and drinks would’ve been great." Cons: "The lounge, they use the club lounge in Boston which was so so. Could we have use the one world BA lounge instead?" Pros: "Everything" Cons: "It could be better if they serve food from Doha to Islamabad." Cons: "Qatar airways claims to have inflight wifi. But it is not true because it did not work in either of my flights. Food could have been better." Cons: "the area I sat in smelled weird even though the crew helped spray a solution it didn’t help the smell .. Vegetarian meal is not good" Pros: "Our flight attendants were all amazing, but especially Joanna!! She was outstanding and went above and beyond to assist us in every way possible!!" Cons: "The changed the time of flight had to wait airport for 5 hrs" Pros: "In my departure flight, there were many empty seats and the crew let us move to another seat to lay down and sleep. Also the food was very good and there was a great selection of movies." Pros: "Excellent customer service, from the check in process, to boarding, to flying 21 hours from Boston to Phuket with infant- we couldn’t have asked for a better experience! Everyone was so accommodating and helpful as we traveled with our 7 month old a lot g distance." Pros: "The cabin crew was very helpful and cheerful and everyone had a smile on their face." Cons: "Entertainment devices are slow to respond." Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "Entertainment didn’t work, the crew did nothing to help. The plane was hot and stuffy. My luggage is lost." Pros: "The crew service was very good, as was the food. The only complain is about the entertainment, hope to update the touch screen." Cons: "I asked the Chinese flight attendant in economy to please ask the man in front of me to put his seat up since the captain and purser had already asked us to do so in three languages The man in front of me refused to do so. She said she was going to start at the front of the plane and let him leave his seat back making it difficult to see my tv monitor. I thought that she should’ve said that it was time to put your seat up. It was frustrating that she didn’t support me and the request of the captain. Your seats are very uncomfortable upright when the person in front of you has their seat back." Pros: "On time; smooth boarding process; lights dimmed for a reasonably long time." Cons: "NO legroom on the Zurich to Dusseldorf flight." Pros: "On time arrival" Cons: "Boston -Zurich, the most uncomfortable seat possible. I am 5’2 and I barely fit....

An added bonus was the chocolate they gave us. Crew was professional and courteous." Pros: "The staff upgraded me to business. It was a great wxperience" Pros: "There were good entertainment options though I didn’t use them" Cons: "Our flight was delayed 2.5 hours, during which we had boarded but were told we could not leave our seats even for the bathroom. We were offered a cup of water once during this delay which is inexcusable. (We were also woken up to serve dinner at 1am so that was incredibly inconvenient for an overnight flight) On top of that, I, as well as many others missed our connecting flight. Personally I missed my connection by 20 minutes, which seems a reasonable amount of time to hold a connecting flight with so many people from our flight on that next one. In missing by only 20 minutes, we have lost an entire day of our trip and are spending 9! hours in the airport today. There was no communication between flights clearly. Despite there being an earlier flight we could’ve been placed on after missing our connection - we did not get booked on this flight. I asked why and they just randomly placed people on random flights with no regard for when we showed at the desk. In this scenario, a first come first serve would have alleviated an absolutely awful experience. I will never fly Swiss Air again and will urge people I know to not fly this airline. The experience was extremely frustrating, the best response from an employee was “that’s all I can do for you” and I wish it on no one." Pros: "The planes are clean and relatively comfortable." Cons: "Extremely rigid rules. My flight was the day of the blizzard in Boston, Tues, 3/13. Despite 5 calls to Swiss to reroute me out of Montreal, an airport I could actually get to, they would not relent. I finally just drove there and a really nice agent changed my flight since Logan was closed and all public transport was shut down. Even if my scheduled flight from boston wasn't canceled (I have no idea) they were incredibly unhelpful about the fact that I physically could not get to logan in time for my flight. (Mass DOT was asking everyone to stay off ALL roads). THEN on the way home, they would NOT let me fly back to Montreal where my car was!! WAY TOO RIGID RULES. Screw the customer!" Pros: "I enjoying having an aisle seat plus two empty seats next to me. I appreciated that you are conserving plastic cups. Keep up the conservation!" Cons: "All of our luggage was lost and did not arrive in Prague" Cons: "Tv screen didn’t work very well. ( picture was fine but the function buttons were terrible)." Pros: "Smooth quiet flight." Cons: "Mac and cheese isn’t what I was expecting for vegetarian." Pros: "I have never been treated so poorly by counter people in my life!" Cons: "After 2 hour delay, the flight was cancelled. NO ONE helped to find another flight. After waiting in line for 2 hours, the ticket agent handed me a card and said I had to call the 800 number. The person on the phone said I had to talk to ticket agent to go standby on a flight to Munich and the ticket agent told me I had to call. I was caught in a loop and no one helped. Then when it became apparent I wasn't getting out that night I was informed that there were no hotel vouchers and I would have to find my own hotel! After searching for an hour for a hotel (all were sold out in Boston) I called a friend who lives outside of Boston. No one gave me a taxi voucher because it was not to a hotel. LUFTHANSA customer service is the WORST!!!!!!!!" Pros: "Cuteous service" Cons: "Seats were to close together, nomlegroom, impossible when set in front reclined. Breakfast food meager." Cons: "Passport control in Frankfurt was slow, very long linen under staffed" Pros: "The staff was friendly and professional" Cons: "The seats were too cramped, no chance to sleep on an overnight flight. In fact my back was quite sore from being cramped in the seat with no leg room and no under seat room for a small backpack. I’m only 5’2”" Pros: "The cabin crew was very friendly and professional. The food was good too. The flight was right on time." Cons: "Very little leg room, when perso in front of you reclines it’s impossible to open table" Pros: "Pleasant and efficient crew made a middle of the night flight (01.00 - 05.30) quite bearable! Food good too." Pros: "I' not sure which flight this relates to. I've taken economy and business class and clearly the business class is better but economy is fine. The crew were good in both classes and whilst the food in business was better I didn't have a problem in economy either." Cons: "Check in was fine and very friendly but boarding could be better particularly in business. At Heathrow it was a bit chaotic as all classes seemed to be mixed up so it was difficult for priority passengers such as disabled to get through everyone crowded up to the desks and the same applied for business class as well. The IFE wasn't too bad but it could be better. Bahrain airport is a mess and the boarding gates seem to be more like corridors with seats in them so it's difficult again when they call for business class passengers as unless you are already at the front you have to try to work your way through. I believe the airport is being rebuilt. If so then things will probably improve. I'm not sure why there needs to be 2 security checks within a few yards of each other when transiting between flights. they don't have this problem in Doha." Cons: "Not lied to me about my extra being payed from Bahrain to Kenya because it was only payed to Dubai which is now causing me a lot of stress my flight from Dubai to Nairobi was cancelled while i was there without my knowledge" Pros: "Friendly and helpful flight crew Good food Free movies to warch" Pros: "Coffe" Cons: "Have to wait along time to get the tickets of the connection" Pros: "Crew were very friendly, aircraft were very comfortable compared to other economic airway companies" Cons: "Bahrain airport," Pros: "airplane." Cons: "flt from Bah operated by Gulfair, so checked in with them. They were able to checkin bags to Manchester but not able to issue boarding card. length of flight when alternative is a direct flight from bah to lhr. Sinbad ffp website not easy. for a new aircraft the ife selection was very poor." Pros: "The flight was on time and everyone from the ground crew to cabin crew were making sure to secure an on time performance. Checking in and boarding was swift. The flight was short and sweet. De-boarding was quick and taken back to the terminal in a bus." Cons: "The cabin crew looked sad. Not a single one of them had a smile on their face. There was no welcome when I got on the aircraft, I was not woken up for food and was not asked later if I wanted something to eat." Cons: "Delay of 4 hours as connection was gone , costumer care not answering, transfer desk very un professional, very bad management of delay .
