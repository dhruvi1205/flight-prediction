I was impressed. Very eager to assist flight crew First time on Starlux. I was impressed. Very eager to assist flight crew Premium Economy on Starlux- a worthwhile way to cross the Pacific. This is a great premium economy experience. The seats are comfortable, wide and provide decent foot rests. The seatback TV is large, high resolution and plenty of content. Bluetooth connection for your headset and control from your phone is available. Food was decent and in line with the cabin class. The seat could be improved by providing more lower leg support especially for taller guests (6ft myself). Cabin crew will be moving up and down the aisle a lot since the galley is in front. Screen size was nice. No vent when hot, food was not good Wish plane type had more restrooms… Care and consideration from stewards and stewardesses was so great Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "The seat, the food, the services, the boarding could have been better!" Cons: "Let me change my ticket due to a death in the family." Pros: "Flight attendants were the friendliest and most patient I have ever experienced. Great customer service!!!" Cons: "Seats of any airplane could use improvement on comfort. But comfort was good." Pros: "Excellent service and probably the most efficient boarding process I’ve ever been a part of. Food service went by without a hitch, and the stewardesses knew English very well so we felt comfortable and welcomed. I also really liked being able to get terminal/travel information from the infotainment system. Being that I’ve never been to ICN or NRT before, having access to terminal maps and basic instructions on how to find connecting flights and baggage claim areas was probably one of the most helpful features of the flight!" Cons: "I am 5’11” and found my seat somewhat uncomfortable. It didn’t detract from being able to sleep at all, but it did seem like the seats on this airline might be at its most comfortable with shorter passengers." Pros: "The transit lounges at the new Seoul terminal are outstanding." Cons: "Flight delayed which caused me to miss my connecting. This is now causing me to spend an additional 12 hours traveling to the same destination." Pros: "Great customer service. Flight attendants showed passengers a lot of attention. Well done." Cons: "The plane was way too hot! Being trapped in a stuffy plane for 5 hours and sweating was the worst!" Pros: "The general service was amazing. The flights were all super clean, well stocked (they still provided headphones, pillows, and blankets) and nice newer planes. The crew was great as well, their English was pretty good and I never had any issues." Cons: "My original seat assignments were not found so I lost my window seat on one flight." Pros: "The food was very delicious on this trip. I had the seafood dish. Very tasty." Cons: "The movie selection wasn't that good. I was hoping to see the latest Star Wars movie." Cons: "The planes are pretty outdated especially the connecting flights from Narita to HKG" Pros: "Excellent service from the cabin crew." Cons: "The Japanese (Washoku) breakfast was not as good as I expected." Pros: "The crew was great, friendly and helpful. The food was good and the overall service on the plane was great." Cons: "Our flight was delayed from Los Angeles and we did not make our connecting flight in Tokyo. The next option they had was a full 24 hours later so we ended up taking the train. I tried to make adjustments to one of my flights for the return home and was told that is not an option." Pros: "They were very helpful in changing my seat to an aisle seat. The first meal was rather mediocre. The second one was good. The seats were spacious and comfortable and I did not feel claustrophobic." Cons: "They were very helpful in changing my seat to an aisle seat. The first meal was rather mediocre. The second one was good. The seats were spacious and comfortable and I did not feel claustrophobic." Pros: "The flight was late checking in. The staff handled the situation well and kept the passengers informed." Pros: "Very comfortable flights. Exceptional crew on and off the planes. Great food and drink/snack options. Lots of entertainment options as well." Cons: "I have no complaints abouts my flights. Travel is tough at times but ANA made it seem easy." Pros: "Everything about this airline made my flight pleasant. The staff were polite and accommodating" Cons: "Couldn’t print or get boarding pass for this connecting flight which was a bit annoying. Other than that, everything was amazing" Pros: "Take off and landing was smooth. Stewardesses were very helpful." Pros: "Boarding was easy and efficient. Crew was tirelessly courteous and respectful. The entertainment system had a good selection, but I've seen better. The food and drink service was excellent. Seats had charging jackass for phones. I'd fly with them again" Cons: "Internet was more expensive than it should be" Pros: "Singapore Airlines has everything worked out for you before you land. That's a great help. The stewardesses were just phenomenal and endlessly polite. I will definitely use them again." Cons: "As much as I normally nitpick something, I literally have no criticism at all of Singapore Airlines. Everything they did was a step above everyone else." Cons: "Flight was a little warm but was able to get it cooler via help from crew but got warmer again towards the end of flight. Overall good flight though" Cons: "The lunch part at the end was a little late we had just had a snack and a small sandwich so we didn't eat a lot. But food was great!" Pros: "crew handled the tough crowd well, but were not extremely hospitable" Cons: "food was disgusting" Pros: "Flight was full but crew was attentive and very pleasant. Star Alliance Lounge at LAX had a good variety of food and drinks - Asian, western, small bites, snacks; red, white, bubbly and even a bartender who'll mix up cocktails. I love flying SQ." Cons: "For a premium economy service, it was really good." Pros: "Everything. New plane amazing food on a two hour flight Great new entertainment system on the seat back." Cons: "A little more leg room." Pros: "The inflight entertainment was great, lots of movie selections" Cons: "The leg room was horrible. Honestly the worst space I've ever had in a flight. I was shocked considering Singapore air is considered one of the best airlines" Pros: "They treated you like you were important and really took care of my every need" Cons: "Getting on a cattle car to go to another terminal and then get in line again to go on the plane" Pros: "Crew was very friendly and responsive to my needs. They met it with a smile." Pros: "I loved everything! The plane was well maintained, the crew were friendly and attentive, the flight was comfortable even for such long hours. Food was also great! In flight entertainment had recent movies and shows, even international selections." Pros: "The crew and food was great. The legroom not so great." Pros: "Everything from crew to food was great. For a 14 hour flight its helpful to have good service." Cons: "Nothing" Cons: "The seat smells like it was not clean. They did not serve snack between lunch and dinner. You need to get it at their station. We were really thirsty and a bit hungry..." Pros: "Crew was the best part. They were very friendly and helpful." Cons: "Very limited English movie selections for such a long flight. Could not turn Chinese subtitles off for some. Very distracting. Seats in economy (according to online comparisons) are some of the best in the industry but I felt extremely cramped and uncomfortable for the entire flight. Long haul flights should not have seats this small. Also, for health reasons, all seats should have foot rests. It shouldn't be about money, people can die from sitting like that for so long. Also, the food that I could eat was good, but there should be a no fish option. You have a lot of diet types available to choose from but none guarantee no fish. The process for requesting a special meal online was not clear and confusing." Pros: "Clean plane" Cons: "Food was horrible, flight Attendants are professional but cold as ice." Pros: "Our flight from LA to Tapei was outstanding. We were served 2 full meals and both meals exceeded my expectations in terms of quality. The entertainment options were decent, there were several TV shows with recent episodes available to watch as well as a good sized library of movies including some new releases." Cons: "The only thing I would ask for is more than 4 episodes of each TV show. Overall our flight was great." Pros: "I like the food and entertainment. But they should served drinks more often as possible rather than waiting for the customer to ask for it." Pros: "Lots of flight attendants to deal with such a large plan of passengers. They came around often with snacks and refreshments." Cons: "Entertainment was a little lacking." Cons: "Since I traveled with my daughter (4yo), I got to board early from LAX to TPE but my second flight from TPE to BKK, I had to wait till they called my zone seat. I was holding my daughter at that point since they took away my stroller way earlier than the boarding time. I would like to ask for the same standard of parents traveling with children who are 6 or younger to board first so they can get settle and these patents are tiring from dealing with their children during the flight. They are extra tired than regular passengers." Pros: "Overall Eva is a good airline (certainly beats United), but had a problem with the meal request." Cons: "Requested child meal at the same time as booking seats (all online). Seats were as reserved, but had no record of child meal request."
