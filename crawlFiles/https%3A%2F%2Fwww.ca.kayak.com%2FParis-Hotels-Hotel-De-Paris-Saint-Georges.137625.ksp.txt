Cons:we believe that the detergent and/or cleaning supplies might have given us allergic reactions. bar downstairs made friday and Saturday nights teally loud. A 9.6 Wonderful Anonymous, Aug. 2014 Pros:The staff was very friendly and helpful. The location was great, since it's near non touristy cafes and the 12 metro line. The rooms were clean and comfortable - not luxury hotel status but perfect for a vacation on a budget. Also if you're lucky enough to get a top floor room the view of Paris is great! Cons:Nothing.
