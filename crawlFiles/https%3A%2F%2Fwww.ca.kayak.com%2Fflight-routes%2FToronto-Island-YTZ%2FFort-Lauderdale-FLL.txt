Cons: "As expected this is a commuter flight so very stripped down in terms of amenities. Tight plane seating and those overhead bins just barely accommodate the carry on." Pros: "The crew was good and boarding was super efficient" Cons: "No entertain on the plane. Since when YTZ offered no more complimentary drinks and some snack?" Pros: "Very convenient, non stops and airport is close to downtown" Cons: "Captain said the 1 hour delay was due to bad weather in Washington DC but there was no bad weather in DC. He should have said the truth. I was in flight 729 from Toronto to Washington Dulles airport on 7/7." Cons: "The 4pm flight not leaving at 10pm. Or at least being informed that the flight was gonna be delayed before 3 pm" Cons: "I was required to pay for my carryon, which I was never informed during my booking." Pros: "I felt like I was taken advantage of by porter airlines" Cons: "They didn’t tell me I had to pay 110$ to bring on carry on luggage! Unacceptable. I will never fly porter again." Pros: "Porter airlines is efficient and the customer service is the best I have experienced." Cons: "I miss the free amenities that they used to offer at the Billy Bishop airport, but the newly renovated airport is nice!" Cons: "Our checked in bags did not come out on the carousel, instead they had been sitting on the ground beside another carousel - with no notification. There was a handful of us waiting 30+ mins for our bags and no one around to assist." Pros: "n/A" Cons: "Was not offered a flight back to Ottawa, had to find a ride from Toronto to Ottawa once we landed .6 hours driving. See above." Pros: "The seats were comfortable and even roomy, compared to many other airlines." Cons: "Two minor drawbacks: (1) In the Porter lounge, where I was stuck between connecting flights, the cost of food was too high. (2) The weather buffets these small planes more than would be the case with jetliners." Cons: "Lots of time waiting to disembark. Some free snacks would be nice to." Pros: "The crew and counter check in were provided excellent customer service. Very impressed." Cons: "My son and I are both 6’5” and the seat are too close together for leg comfort. Flying used to be about COMFORT for passengers. I paid for our seating thinking we would get extra legroom with emergency seating, I was disappointed." Pros: "Air Transat provide excellent service with affordable prices. I have arrived late to check-in desk due to unexpected traffic but Air Transat team was very supportive, even helped us to cross the customs in no-time until the gate of the plane without interrupting the flight time. Highly Recommended." Pros: "Loved the extra leg room." Cons: "Food was horrible, had two bites and didn’t eat the rest." Pros: "Crew was good" Cons: "Old plane... not much room for legs and seating are uncomfortable! No personal entertainment système! Poor flight" Pros: "Old plane so seat pitch was good" Cons: "Maintenance issues meant a 2 hour delay where we stayed on the plane" Pros: "Crew was great, seats could have been better for the fare we paid..." Cons: "The food was not the meal we ordered" Cons: "Paid in advance (6 months!!) for a seat with more space for legs Got a regular seat instead With no explanation or reimbursement... very disappointed!" Cons: "Flught was 90 mins late leaving becuse of equipment failure. Missed my meeting." Pros: "Flow as smooth , attendants were good." Cons: "Boarding was delayed and then we sat about an hour on board waiting to get de-iced. Ended up over 1 1/2 hours late." It was a pleasure flying, great seats , lots of room, pleasant staff. The flight was delayed for over an hour and a half. There were no delays with the flight and check-in was fast and easy. When a person pays 500 $ for one way ticket that person should have better seat not the seat before the bathrooms.🤔🤨 No hot food, Due to delayed boarding during the first flight, I had no time to buy hot food in between connections. No earphones available readily, even when I choose to purchase Seating is very tight. We were delayed 90 minutes to board, because the flight crew were late Cons: "I have flown Air Canada many times, and have never taken off on time. Most flights I have been on, were 30 -60 minutes late. Cabin service is usually minimal, lackadaisical, and indifferent. I would only fly Air Canada again as a last resort" Pros: "Very organized crew for the boarding on instructing passengers with carry-ons etc for the overhead storage compartments. Flight left on time." Cons: "My entertainment screen was malfunctioning. Very frustrating trying to watch a movie to the point I turned it off & read a book . If you are going to offer the the service make sure it works." Pros: "If there is good weather, everything will run smooth and on time." Cons: "Be aware of the snow... My flight from YUL (Montreal) to FLL was delayed 4 hours!! The inbound flight was diverted to Toronto just because of ONE inch of snow in Montreal Airport." Pros: "Many airlines have code share flights but it is better to buy ticket directly from the original airline as they keep on ignoring the code share flight bookings" Cons: "Till last moment we were kept hanging if we will board or not as no seat number was allocated. I believe it was as we were from the code share airline not the real one" Porter Airlines7.7 Air Transat7.2 Air Canada7.1 Book cheap flights from Toronto to Fort Lauderdale Recent one-way flight deals Only flying one-way?
