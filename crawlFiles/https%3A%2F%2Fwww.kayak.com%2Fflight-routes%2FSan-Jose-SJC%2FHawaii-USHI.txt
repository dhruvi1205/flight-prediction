Also appreciated when they were able to accommodate last minute meal changes!!"Read more about Japan Airlines Pros: "I like how the crew made rounds hourly to provide drinks and ensure we are good! Also appreciated when they were able to accommodate last minute meal changes!!" Cons: "Delayed flight for 2 hours, rude staff at the JFK airport and then v choppy flight, delayed even more by waiting for an arrival gate in FLL." Pros: "It was great..." Cons: "Lavatories on domestic flights in Japan are tiny. Like, super duper tiny." Pros: "I didn’t get on this flight. Due to the departure at LAX. It would’ve been nice to know that this was a possibility before the arrival. Although the ladies at Japan Airlines were able to get me on a later flight, it almost didn’t happen. But the kept making calls to help me. I’m very thankful they were able to get me on ANA flight at 8pm." Cons: "Communication" Pros: "The crew that checked me and those who were onboard were very helpful and cheerful." Cons: "Better choices of movies on board." Pros: "Two choices of meal, friendlier staff, better head cushion. Props to JAL." Pros: "Service was excellent. Premium economy seats well worth the few extra $$." Pros: "Service was excellent" Cons: "Cabin and all associates accessories, seats and entertainment center needed replacement. Electrical outlets didn’t work. JAL retire that plane" Pros: "They were very accommodating and helped ensure a good travel experience (first time traveling with a young child)." Pros: "I enjoyed everything! My first flight was a little over 10 hours, but it didn't feel that way. I was very comfortable and the crew took very good care of all of the passengers. Japan Airlines is Ichi Ban!!!" Pros: "The crew members were to patience with everyone and making sure everyone have a comfortable flight." Cons: "N/A" Pros: "The crew was very nice on all four flights: ATL-FLL-CUN and CUN-FLL-ATL" Cons: "I did not like the boarding in CUN returning to FLL The boarding was delayed because of the security pat-down at the gate. The video got cut-off mid-flight and was never properly restored." Pros: "Cleo, our fly attendees made us feel right at home!" Pros: "Comfortable seats, quick staff getting us boarded a little early so we arrived early!" Cons: "Was great!" Pros: "Good leg room Love the deboarding process from the back" Cons: "N/a" Cons: "Good overall experience, paying for pillow, blanket and headphones a bit much" Pros: "San Jose boarding was very quick and orderly to New York. And, The TV was not working and the flight attendants were very kind to let me sit in an empty seat to watch TV." Pros: "Crew was nice and the flight was fine" Cons: "I was quite shocked that the seat I had originally been put in the head phone jack and The Wholearea where the channel changes was falling apart. I was able to switch seats due to flight being not full but that would be annoying. I also was weirded out that they did not ha e touch screens. In general the plane just seemed old and dirty to me." Pros: "Crew did a great job overall. They were fast and friendly. We got out 15 minuets early too. Nice job!!" Pros: "The Blond flight attendant was amazing. She handled all the folks extremely well." Pros: "NA" Cons: "Informing that the flight would delayed by three hours ahead of time would have been amazing. Instead of extending the delayed time every 45 min making us miss all the other opportunities to fly out" Pros: "Leg room" Cons: "Not sitting in an airplane without AC for 30 minutes after everyone loaded" Pros: "Crew was great, very generous with snacks and beverages, and prior to boarding we were able to switch flights and seats without problem. All the Delta agents were extremely helpful, and had great customer service!" Cons: "Far in advance I requested a seat with extra leg room for a back condition that is supported by a physicians note. The seat did not appear to me to have extra leg room. I was very uncomfortable."

People all over were asking for blankets and commenting on the coldness" Pros: "Everything! I appreciate that the ticketing agent helped me get an earlier flight and I appreciated the gate agent making sure I had a good seat! I love Delta!"

Cons: "On my delta app it said we’d have the TVs again but we didn’t have any this time." Cons: "Smallest plane ever. Absolutely no leg room or overhead space." Pros: "The flight back to Columbus made up for the flight from CLT to SJC." Cons: "This was a multi city, round trip starting out of CLT. My connection was way too close, and we missed the connection due to a mechanical problem. The lines to get vouchers were super long, and the hotel was not the best. It was way after midnight when I got to the hotel, and I did not feel safe staying at a Quality Inn. I had to walk to my room outside, and had leave in the morning in the dark as well. I was traveling alone. Please put your passengers in a better hotel, closer to the airport. I did not expect that from American Airlines." Cons: "Running out of bin space by Group 3 is just wrong." Pros: "Comfortable flight and was able to get a couple hours of sleep in." Pros: "Take offs were a few minutes late but we arrived on time at each destination due to savvy pilots and great tailwinds.

Wasted so much time." Cons: "Another delay on second segment of cross country flight — this time for maintenance issues that were never fully explained. took off an hour late from DFW." Pros: "Great flight overall" Cons: "We were told that we get one checked bag free, but at check-in were told we had to pay. So much for low prices!" Pros: "The flight itself was fine." Cons: "All the choices to eat were laden with gluten, salt, and sugar. Surely a salad is no heavier than what they carry, but might not last as long. For those of us gluten-sensitive, watching our glucose levels, or salt intake there’s nothing. A 40 minute gate change from B29 to A11 in PHX was barely long enough to walk far less find and buy a healthy meal. Yet again I arose at 4am and had nothing to eat until after 4pm. ALL the airlines can do better." Cons: "There should be more number of check in bags for passengers. At the least the overhead bins should be allowed to the passengers." Cons: "More food options would have been great. I asked for the everything bun burger but didn’t get it brought to me." Pros: "I liked the service of the flight attendants and the crew." Cons: "The wifi partially worked but I was trying to download songs onto my device and the wifi didn’t let me download anything." Pros: "The crew was excellent; courteous and professional." Cons: "More room for overhead bags so checking carry-on isn’t necessary" Cons: "Check in was slow, I had to pay $130 for 4lbs of overweight bag, $200 to change a flight, they screwed up the first change and almost charged $200 more until I asked them to review the “quality assurance” call, the flight was delayed because they had to find a new crew, and again because of a part." Pros: "Staff was nice. Comfy seats." Cons: "They had to check mom's little bag, so we had to move things into her carry on that she needed." Pros: "Good pilots" Cons: "Service is dismal and run down interior. Rips in seats. Lags way behind Asian or certain European airlines" Cons: "Stop pretending I can take a carry on. I'm boarding last, and guaranteed I'm going to have to check my carry-on." Cons: "The seats are getting smaller and the leg space is nonexistent." Pros: "Everyone was nice, and the flight was on time. Checked in with the app and just a carry on, so my day was hassle free." Cons: "Can't really think of anything. It was a good flight." Cons: "Delayed flight caused missed connection. Auto booked on late flight next day and had to change airlines to get better times. Voucher given for hotel off airport and shuttle never arrived and had to take Uber. Hotel very low quality."
