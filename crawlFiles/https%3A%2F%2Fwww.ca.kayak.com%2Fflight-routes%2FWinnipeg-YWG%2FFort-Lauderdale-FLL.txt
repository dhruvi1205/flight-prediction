Cons: "I would have liked to have had WestJet internet and entertainment access. It was not offered on our flight from Toronto to Fredericton."

Buzzed them servial times and no response." Cons: "Early on first flight on arrival but late departing by 30 mins due to westjet delay of crew" Cons: "Limited snack, no entertainment without a tablet of some type. Cargo restraint broke and delayed the flight for an hour." Pros: "The trip served its purpose in getting us from point A to B. Good" Cons: "Plane was delayed. Wanted to sleep during flight but couldn’t because flight attendants were chatting loudly amongst themselves" Pros: "Everything from ticketing to check in to flight. They are a passenger friendly airline" Cons: "Nothing" The TV shows available were way better than other AC flights. Most have only 3 episodes which doesn’t make sense. The flight was delayed for over an hour and a half. There were no delays with the flight and check-in was fast and easy. No hot food, Due to delayed boarding during the first flight, I had no time to buy hot food in between connections. No earphones available readily, even when I choose to purchase Cons: "I have flown Air Canada many times, and have never taken off on time. Most flights I have been on, were 30 -60 minutes late. Cabin service is usually minimal, lackadaisical, and indifferent. I would only fly Air Canada again as a last resort" Pros: "Very organized crew for the boarding on instructing passengers with carry-ons etc for the overhead storage compartments. Flight left on time." Cons: "My entertainment screen was malfunctioning. Very frustrating trying to watch a movie to the point I turned it off & read a book . If you are going to offer the the service make sure it works." Cons: "Late departure- even with snow issues have not had similar problems with WestJet" Cons: "When I had to change my wife's ticket due to an emergency, we were charged over $415.00. That is unfair." Pros: "Their sympathy for our atrocious wait was, free pop and water, and some pretzels. $30 meal vouchers at the limited options gate area, which could only be used towards a meal (really? no where else?). Here's a were sorry email and a discount on your next flight with us. I have yet to see how much the significant cost for that discount but my expectations of Air Canada are very low." Cons: "That delay was horrendous, I spent 10 hours at an airport. I woke up so god damn early to get there because of news spreading the worries of people waiting at customs immigration to the U.S. it only took us 40min to get through and the flight delay notice was given an hour and a half before departure. We couldn't even sleep on any benches because they were all designed for individuals to sit. It wasn't until our gate location moved to the end of that area was there any carpeted floor space to sleep on. On the flight, economy seating was very tight with limited leg room, and best of all our seats had no window, literally every other row in our section had a window. Air Canada handled this stressful event very poorly, once they figured out bringing a new air craft hours later, and everyone moved to the new gate area, all the attendants had left from their gate post until 40min before the flight which was hours later." Pros: "Roomy plane." Cons: "Restroom no working for disabled. Boarding was disorganized and chaotic."
