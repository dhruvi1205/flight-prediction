Cons: "The aircraft looked new. However the seat widths seemed small. Awkward recline as well. The seats were just not comfortable." Cons: "Flight delayed, sat on plane on ground for 4 hours then missed connecting flight." Pros: "Seats were comfortable" Cons: "Please make an announcement to passengers to not be dismissive if their surroundings. Passenger in front of me was has no regard for people behind him. Kept throwing himself in seat aggressively which cause water/food on trail to fall over. Thanks" Pros: "The boarding process was easy" Cons: "Some of the crew members were rude and inconsiderate - if you see that someone is sleeping, you don’t stand at their seat and lean on it and shake it while you’re waiting to give the security demo before take off." Pros: "Flight crew was on top of things. Flight was smooth and ontime." Cons: "A bit cramped in the economy class. Could have been more room for the money we had to spend on tickets" Cons: "Flight was cancelled. I was rebooked on different flight, arriving in total 6 hours later than planned. My train connection was not valid, and I hhad to buy another ticket." Pros: "The crew" Cons: "Boarding by rows and not like cows all at one time" Pros: "There was an abundance of drink carts and dining options, snacks. Thank you!" Cons: "Some of these planes need improved entertainment systems. Half did not work." Cons: "They ran out of the dinner with meat option. They offered sandwiches to some people as a snack but not sure why some people got them. The crew is okay not that friendly." Pros: "We called for seats 23 hours prior to flight. To our amazement we were assigned to an exit row." Cons: "It was an easy 2.5 hrs. flight at which a small warm quiche was served. Nice surprise." Coldest flight I’ve ever been on. The crew noticed as well but weren’t able to fix the situation. It was like camping in late fall when you sleep with a toque and sleeping bag but you still freeze your nose off! would be easier if earphone was provided or wifi was free . No point having entertainment when you can’t listen with wifi earswt flight was cancelled at an hour's notice- it appears that when flights are not full, customers are left to fend for themselves. I missed my one and only conference in 6 years, and the 900$ charge was not refundable. Over an hour to check baggage. Baggage lost for over 3 days but was found and delivered to second hotel while on International tour. Seats were a tight fit when three people seated, On Air Canada Rouge plane no food and limited snacks. Air Canada plane better seats and snacks and food provided which was good.. Delayed ,Canceled flight and lost luggage experience, thus not a great rating. Cons: "The flight itself was great but it was very late in starting due to technical problems with the aircraft." Pros: "NA" Cons: "The flight did not wait for me due to the 1st flight delay." Pros: "The food and entertainment were ok. Not happy I missed the next connecting flight" Cons: "Delay" Pros: "I love this flight. Great airplane and great staff. Air Canada international >> air Canada domestic." Pros: "Many airlines have code share flights but it is better to buy ticket directly from the original airline as they keep on ignoring the code share flight bookings" Cons: "Till last moment we were kept hanging if we will board or not as no seat number was allocated. I believe it was as we were from the code share airline not the real one" Pros: "Entertainment system has a bunch of varieties to keep you entertained for a 12 hour flight." Cons: "The delays were horrible!!! Had 4 flights with them. Seattle to Vancouver, Vancouver to Beijing, Hong Kong to Vancouver, and Vancouver to Seattle. Seattle to Vancouver was delayed so long that we almost missed our connecting flight to Beijing. Because of that delay our baggage missed the Vancouver to Beijing flight and we had nothing for 2 days!!! It was a hassle to get some kind of compensation and just having to wear the same clothes for 2 days. Also the Hong Kong to Vancouver, and Vancouver to Seattle flights were also delayed" SWISS8.0 Air Canada7.1 Book cheap flights from Toronto to Reykjavik Recent one-way flight deals Only flying one-way?
