Pleasant attendants, timely luggage to carousels.Read more about Air North Service was great from start to finish. Pleasant attendants, timely luggage to carousels. This airline is never a disappointment. Always on time. Short haul from YLW to YYZ , best way to travel. Boarding was fine, and flight was on time. During the flight however, you aren't even offered a drink of water. The carts never leave the galleys. All the attendants said the whole time is take your headphones off and buckle your seatbelt. For the price I wouldn't expect 5 star service, but maybe a drink would have been acceptable Nothing needs to change as it is such a short flight. The employees at the counter when we first arrived were very helpful and kind. The flight attendants were are very pleasant and helpful. I appreciated we departed on time. Pros: "Price was the best over competitors. Many dates available. Staff are friendly and service oriented. Coffee is so good. Food is great. Flight was on time." Cons: "I booked online and then had to rebook - by calling the call centre. Be good to have the ability to change flights online as well. Call centre staff was good - except I assumed she’d book us sitting in the same seats as I had originally chosen (which were available - as I checked online)." Pros: "Service was good, frequent drinks and snacks, nice little deli platter was unexpected and very delicious!" Pros: "You constantly got food and drinks served, a big contrast to the other airlines who don't even serve complimentary food on 5 hour trips. We didn't expect to get food on this 2 hour flight so we had breakfast beforehand. We were pleasantly surprised!" Pros: "Friendly staff. Provided sandwich and cookie during flight." Cons: "Minor item: Didn't provide hav charger in seats but for short flights not a big issue" Pros: "From the coffee and cookies while waiting to board to the freshly baked items given while receiving food service, this is great customer service. Not to mention the competitively priced airfare and not having to pay an extra fee for checked bags, this airline can't be beat. I would definitely fly it again and suggest it to anyone if they're looking to fly in northern Canada." Cons: "Wake people up when serving anything.. I have seen in some other airlines that one is provided with a sticker to place on your seat to show if you can or cannot be woken up" Cons: "The baggage restriction was not good at least one Checking should be allowed" Pros: "Casual attitude." Cons: "better food option than a few dusty pretzels and a thimble of water." Pros: "Always a pleasure when flying with Westjet. Crew is always better than Air Canada" Cons: "Update the seats please. They are so old and there was no cushion" Pros: "Early arrival" Cons: "Cabin cleanliness. There were flies nesting in the window of the row in front of me." Cons: "Our trip got completely rerouted - we are still in Edmonton and expected to be with family in Regina a couple of hours ago. :(((" Pros: "The crew was very nice" Cons: "Seats are uncomfortable and there’s no tv for entertainment." Cons: "One of the crew members seemed really bother by everything. She was not smiling or even looking at customers when handing drinks over." Cons: "From Vancouver to Los Angeles no screen seats no Entertainment" Pros: "Seat wasn't great but on time boarding was awesome" New jet. Lots of leg room. On time departure. Early arrival. Reasonable airfare. Excellent online experience. I had checked in online the day before but was instructed to collect our boarding passes when we arrived. I am not completely comfortable using the automated Kiosks and always enjoy the nostalgia of speaking with someone when checking in for a flight. Upon doing so however, we were immediately asked,"did you check in online already?" To which I replied, "yes, but we were asked to retrieve our boarding passes upon arrival." She then said, "that's what those machines over there are for. We really encourage people to use those." That unfortunately sparked a series of shortness and overall poor behavior in my opinion from the woman who checked us in. I understand it was early in the morning but I am always excited to experience flying and that interaction has unfortunately left a bitter taste in my mouth to the point I will forever now hesitate to book with Porter again. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Cheers, JD Everything was fantastic, by far the best airline experience in Canada 🇨🇦! Unlike our porter connection this was great , smooth 2minutes at check in not 90 mins Food wasn’t great but it’s plane food , staff were great Porter, like most airlines, need to improve their baggage policies. In reality, there are no longer 'cheap flights' because passengers pay exorbitant baggage fees. Pros: "Efficient check in. Liked the shuttle bus service from subway to airport." Cons: "As expected this is a commuter flight so very stripped down in terms of amenities. Tight plane seating and those overhead bins just barely accommodate the carry on." Pros: "The crew was good and boarding was super efficient" Cons: "No entertain on the plane. Since when YTZ offered no more complimentary drinks and some snack?" Pros: "Flight was fine" Cons: "So many delays which missed our connection. Very costly. It’s the next day and I’m still not to Montreal!" Pros: "The crew was great and friendly." Cons: "Nothing, I think for the flight duration it was good." Pros: "Very convenient, non stops and airport is close to downtown" Cons: "Captain said the 1 hour delay was due to bad weather in Washington DC but there was no bad weather in DC. He should have said the truth. I was in flight 729 from Toronto to Washington Dulles airport on 7/7." Complimentary snacks or meals should be offered on a flight more than 3 hours long. Air Canada is not a low-cost airline. The choice and availability of food on the in-flight bistro was limited and pricey. The in-flight entertainment system was not very good and no complimentary headsets were available. The in-flight maps did not work. I had an earlier Air Canada flight and appreciated them holding the plane while I literally ran for the gate to board this flight. The flight had to be rerouted due to the delay in the first leg. Upon landing Air Canada had been proactive and booked us on another direct flight . We chose an earlier flight and got in a couple if hours earlier. . No problem rebooking and our luggage arrived with us I would definitely fly Air Canada again. I counted down on food but these days I don't know any airline that provides "good" food. Paid for the upgrade to Comfort Class with sky miles. Well worth it! Pros: "The crew was very professional and friendly" Cons: "Well for the most part it was my first experience so it was good, thank you." Pros: "Crew was good." Cons: "Flight was very late (about 90 minutes). Not good, especially after a long flight to Van from New Zealand." Cons: "The flight was fine, but the aircraft arrived 3 hours late. That’s a long wait." Pros: "Nothing much" Cons: "Please train this guys for customer service and fix there attitude." Pros: "They have the best blankets! I always get cold but the blankets are nice and thick. The entertainment system was easy to use with a wide variety to choose from. The seats are comfortable and easy to sleep in. Overall just a great comfortable trip!" Flight delayed by 4 hours but no communication. With passengers until after the posted departure time became apparent the flight was not going to board even close to on time. Flight was sent canceled. The absolute most useless staff I have ever witnessed. Utterly careless - literally could not care less. 100% never using this airline again. Poor communication at the check in counter and boarding gates. Other then the screaming baby the flight was fine, nothing special Check in experience was smooth, and the flight attendants were courteous and friendly. Very positive experience overall, thank you all! Flight arrived late but other than that everything else okay Great price for a new plane. Only offered water which we knew.
