Slum area full of black people just outside the hotel. All staff are also same. One black taxi driver came inside hotel and misbehaved but other of their community inside the hotel didn’t say a thing. He even slapped and pushed the guest. No one said anything. They even ask for a fee if you put luggage for few hours after your stay. Overall it will be a worst trauma to go through. Don’t book this hotel ever.
