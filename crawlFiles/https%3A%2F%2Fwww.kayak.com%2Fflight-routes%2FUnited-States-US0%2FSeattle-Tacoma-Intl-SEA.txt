My 11 year old daughter has to sit by herself as we were unable to get seats near one and other." Cons: "Flight read delayed almost a full hour. My 11 year old daughter has to sit by herself as we were unable to get seats near one and other." Cons: "the original flight was cancelled. the replacement flight was delayed. then we sat on the runway with no updates for almost 40 minutes. and we landed a half hour after the predicted landing time of 115p with no announcements to keep us updated. the woman next to me was stressing because of a connect" Cons: "Southwest crews are usually nice or funny but our male attendant was a grump, giving everyone distainful looks as he took drink orders and not uttering a single other word to us. No one seemed to be in a good mood on this crew except for the other guy waving goodbye to us as we deplaned." Pros: "Their sense of humor and safety first." Cons: "My suitcase was soaked like it had been left out in the rain but my other one was dry. Delayed due to mechanical error for three hours then had to taxi back to gate for weather advisory. I was so tired that I couldn’t relax." Pros: "From car rental to the gate in 20 minutes Every detail went well" Cons: "Our flight was cancelled and we had to wait 8 hours to get another flight" Pros: "Comfy pre-next gen seats. WiFi did not work on this plane. Low clouds at SFO = 2 hour delay." Cons: "delayed 3 times up to 2 hours then advanced take off time after we went to restaurant to get food, and had to rush to get on the plane." Pros: "Quick, friendly, easy boarding, not a full flight, no turbulence, touch down was smooth and quick to the gate." Pros: "Flight was expedient (we landed early), crew was friendly, bags of peanuts, the captain on the second flight was funny and enjoyable after a long day of traveling." Cons: "It's been a while since I flew Southwest, I had forgotten how cramped their seating was (I'm 6'1"), how they don't do assigned seating, which would be fine if I was flying alone, but it created a headache in flying with my wife (who stresses about those sort of things) and a child in a leg cast. The first flight was also extremely bumpy in the first 5 minutes. I've been flying for about 32 years now and never had any worry about planes, but I remember getting nervous for that first 5 minutes (though, that was the second flight I've taken with my family, so I may have been a bit more critical for that factor alone). After that though, it was fine, but there was never an announcement about turbulence or something to ease my worries, so I guess I was a bit nervous." Cons: "I really appreciated the pilot keeping us update on the flight during the storm, I really enjoyed flying with Alaska Airlines" Pros: "I'm usually happy with Alaska flights; I've taken this route so many times--and rarely find fault." Pros: "The person next to me was drunk. The crew was rude." Pros: "The pilot went around to passengers and apologized foe delay." Cons: "3 plus hours of delay????" Pros: "Timing of the flight was always good. Efficient flying. Crew was super helpful too even when passengers were a bit too much." Cons: "Packed flight but the crew and ground staff opened to back door to board more easily. Thanks!" Cons: "Not enough fruit & cheese boxes Sitting in back We were told they ran out way up front!☹️" Pros: "Good crew, did a good job making us feel good for a delayed late night flight." Cons: "For some reason air was never turned on. Air only seemed to flow once we were moving but sitting at the gate and once back on the ground taxing it got very hot again." Pros: "Seats were very comfortable and they provided free movies with a seat console for a 2-hour flight. Great!" Cons: "Nothing" Pros: "Food was excellent service was good" Cons: "Boarding was too slow we sat at gate for almost an hour for baggage to be loaded" Cons: "Two very sick people were allowed to fly and were not denied boarding during these times of Covid19. We actually had to taxi back to terminal to remove a very sick passenger. JetBlue #100 March 17, 2020 10:12 pm from Los Angeles to Fort Lauderdale." Cons: "Despite the delay of almost 3 hours (which we were informed much earlier than getting to the airport at) the plane was 40% empty so can’t complain at the end of the day" Pros: "I love JetBlue! Roomy, well-appointed, great amenities and clean." Cons: "My entertainment system wasn't working. Kept freezing and restarting. I was allowed ton switch seats, but the same thing happened on the others I tried." Pros: "It was my first experience & I couldn’t had enjoyed it more ! Words can’t explain" Cons: "Nothing everything was great" Cons: "Add Subtitles to the movies at list in English thanks Tzach" Pros: "The crew was fine. The seat was not very comfortable. I was quite sore after the 6 hour flight. Entertainment was pretty good and I am happy it was free. I'd appreciate a better selection of current movies, though." Cons: "My SEA to BOS flight was 6 hours late; BOS to SEA departed 30 min late. It was my first time on JetBlue and both my flights were late. Not a great first impression. Also, I hate that JetBlue charges $30 each way for checked baggage. This causes overhead bins to be too full of carry-ons." Pros: "The crew was very friendly and helpful." Cons: "The TV monitor was very small and the picture was pretty poor." Pros: "You can always count on JetBlue for good snacks and free WiFi." Cons: "But the snacks and free WiFi is not enough to payback the delayed departure experience. Just a week prior, my JetBlue flight was scheduled on time and then three things delayed thre flight for three hours right before we took off and now this! I was told it was due to needing to replace a crew member from another delayed flight. How can that affect so many people? The seat was also super uncomfortable and the back of the cushion was rolling forward, which made it hard to sit for that long. we also didn’t have a gate when we landed so that added on an extra 30minutes. Really disappointed." Pros: "Food" Cons: "The scren was not working! This was a bit upsetting at my flight was 5 hours." Really liked the choice of the 4 free snack options. Crew great. Good vibe on plane. There was no wifi even after my husband paid for wifi it wasn’t working. The plane looked and felt old. Flight and seats were great. Food service was average at best. The real main problem we had is that we got cheeseburgers for the kids but the plates was extremely hot. Like ridiculously hot and the stewardess never said anything. Luckily or unluckily my wife touched the plate and was able to deal with it before the kids got burned. Pros: "Crew was solid." Cons: "Don’t change my seat. Not on time. No food. Luggage with legally checked firearm sent to the wrong airport." Pros: "Super friendly and helpful with connections." Cons: "The music on the plane was a bit much. Lol" Cons: "Crew was abrasive and put off by people asking for service. Monitors had to be rebooted 3 times. Ran out of water and snacks." Cons: "connecting flight left without 1/6th of its passengers. Stuck at airport now because of Deltas laziness" Pros: "Decent entertainment options and snack offerings." Cons: "Last 6-8 rows were vacant and for some reason Someone was still seated directly next to me. Why on earth the flight attendants (otherwise great) didn’t make an announcement that there was no need to share a row and encourage people to spread out is beyond me. I mean this is the only flight I can remember in a decade that wasn’t nearly or fully booked, you’d think they’d emphasize that. Instead I got to be trapped like it was a full flight next to a guy with no concept of personal space." Pros: "Good seats. Crew was not very hospitable. They went by with water and didn’t give us any. We upgraded for the complementary cocktails and my husband didn’t even get a chance to get one." Cons: "More attention especially for the upgraded seats that offer complementary things. We got better service in our economy seats on the way to LA. I wouldn’t pay extra to upgrade again." Pros: "No" Cons: "The flight was delayed almost 6 hours, the crew was rude and the “comfort +” seats had very little leg room ." Pros: "Nice crew" Cons: "Smallest seats I’ve ever been in. Late departure because they forgot the plane’s security check in-between flights. Drinks served but no snacks." Cons: "No inflight entertainment. No free snack. $40 for a carry on!" Pros: "Very comfy, roomy seats. Helpful, welcoming staff. Great take-off and landing—very smooth." Cons: "It would be nice to have TV’s in the seats for longer flights." Pros: "It landed early." Cons: "Some complimentary snacks. No extra fee for online check-in. It’s cheaper to you to allow people to check themselves in online than make people check in at the desk that was woefully understaffed. Made it a terrible experience for all" Pros: "I had a middle seat and I was surprisingly comfortable." Cons: "This was a 4 hour flight and they had no food -- really????" Cons: "Terrible delays. Charged me $400 for canceling the flight although it’s their mistake for delays. Then i booked Sun Country flight and didn’t make it. They harmed me $200 and gave me vouchers. Spent $1600 in one day to make it to my destination. Horrible experience." Pros: "The crew were average seats were comfortable." Cons: "Being on time... I missed my connection to Eugene. They boarded late because the plane came in late but then fiddling around with paper work for 20 minutes. We were then one hour late and they unloaded on the ground and bussed us to the terminal making us even more late. Also $40 added at check in" Cons: "Why should we have to buy a seat after already buying a ticket to check-in. The check-in process should be separate from the seat buying process so passengers can check-in without having to buy a seat like all other airlines do. You need to maintain the basics." Cons: "There wasn’t a selection for “not applicable” so I gave low stars where the item didn’t exist I.e. entertainment." Pros: "The ticket price." Cons: "The plane was very hot and stuffy.
