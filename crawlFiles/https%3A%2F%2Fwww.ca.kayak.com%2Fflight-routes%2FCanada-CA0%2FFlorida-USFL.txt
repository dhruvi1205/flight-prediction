There are some nonstop flights from Canada to Florida. Most flights to Florida depart from the East Coast of Canada, so if you wish to book a direct flight, you will have to travel from London Ontario Airport or Toronto Hamilton Airport via Swoop Airlines. If you prefer to travel from Toronto Pearson Airport you can fly via Sunwing Airlines directly from Canada. Which airport is closest to Tallahassee? Tallahassee is the capital of the state of Florida and forms part of the Florida Panhandle in the northwest region of the state. To get there you should first fly into Orlando Airport which is the closest of the major hubs (about 414 km away) and then board a connecting flight from there to Tallahassee International Airport (TLH). I wish to visit the Florida Keys. Which airport should I fly into? The Florida Keys are a series of small islands that mark the southern boundary of the state, from Key Largo to Key West, and are a popular tourist destination. Of the two major airports in the area, Miami Airport is closer than the airport in Ft. Lauderdale, so you should get a connecting flight into Key West International Airport (EYW) from Miami. Which airport is the most convenient to get to the Daytona National Speedway? Orlando Airport is the most convenient to fly into. Although Daytona Beach has its own airport (DAB), you won’t need a connecting flight because there is an airport shuttle bus from MCO which takes just over 1h to get to Daytona Beach.

Orlando International Airport (MCO) is the largest and busiest of them, while Miami International Airport (MIA) and Fort Lauderdale International Airport (FLL) are hubs servicing the southern parts of the state. Tampa International Airport (TPA) is a gateway into the west and the Gulf of Mexico. If you are flying from Ottawa International Airport (YOW) into Florida then your flight will need to make a couple of connecting stops while en-route to Miami International Airport (MIA). The first stop takes place at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW), and from there your second stop will be at New York’s JFK International Airport before continuing to Miami. If you wish to explore the various cities along the western coast, then you should book a flight to Florida that lands at Tampa International Airport. From there, you can visit a few of the cities located along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. These include St. Petersburg, Sarasota and Cape Coral, and even go as far northwest as Pensacola. The south of Florida is home to the state’s biggest lake, Lake Okeechobee, as well as the expansive wetlands of the Everglades National Park. Both Fort Lauderdale and Miami provide great access to the national park, but if you’re hoping to visit the lake first then consider a flight that lands at Fort Lauderdale Airport. MCO Airport is the most centrally located of the major airports and so it’s a perfect launchpad to explore the central and northeastern reaches of the state. From Gainesville and Ocala in the interior, and from Jacksonville to Cape Canaveral along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, all are easily accessible from Orlando’s airport.

Bad flavor, mushy weird and just not good" Pros: "Seat was comfortable and food was nice." Cons: "Crew could’ve been nicer and more helpful. Boarding wasn’t efficient." Pros: "Service overall excellent. Attention to needs of pax." Cons: "Food and beverage can still be improved. Aircraft configuration can be improved. Space too tight to even an average size person." Pros: "Crew are good." Cons: "The agency told me that our seat have been reserved all the way. Butupon check-in yesterday , our seat had not been reserved for the leg Taipe to Seattle flight." Pros: "Crew did their best despite the poor circumstances." Cons: "Be on time, even delayed time was not on time. Seats are tightly packed together. This resulted in cramped seats and not every row having a window. Aircraft pressurization is uncomfortable compared to newer aircrafts. No onboard entertainment system. Only serving of food is small snack and drink" Pros: "On time boarding and no delays Crew and staff are very professional and exceeds customer's service" Cons: "Food need some improvement" Pros: "Premium Economy was worth the $$. Especially when the 1st leg of the flight was 15+ hours. My wife was able to sleep 7+ hours. Comfortable and spacious chairs, with good recline." Cons: "Comfort, I need to get to where I can fly first class" Pros: "Good international films. Food was ok." Cons: "First time the bathrooms did not feel or smell fresh. I fly EVA because of the way they keep their bathrooms clean." Pros: "EVA graciously accept a name correction to my ticket where most of my name was correct but the first name wasnt. A big help. Unlike travelling in and out of China. So, i appreciated this help. Flying out at 2 am and arriving Taipei at 5 am was a good time choice too. Service on board was good. Lots of refreshments served. Nice plates used for meals in economy." Cons: "I wish there was air conditioning. It was very warm ok the plane." Cons: "Finest Airline and service I have encountered and I am almost 2 million miles!" Pros: "Comfortable seats in Premium Economy." Cons: "Seat didn’t recline but moved to a vacant one to sleep. USB charging points didn’t charge my iPad." Pros: "Airbus 350. Very good experience" Cons: "Crew was jumpy. I expect them to be a little more gentle serving food." Pros: "Service, food, excellent. Most of all, the new entertainment system & window in bathroom!" Cons: "1. Business class crew stomped around the cabin, making it noisy, and woke me up constantly. 2. Gallery is very loud and badly situated in business class. 3. Chair itself is old & although it’s lie-flat, makes a very uncomfortable night’s sleep." Pros: "The seats are fairly comfortable, and the service was great." Cons: "The economy seats are obviously not great. The extended legroom seats are still quite narrow, though the legroom is great." Pros: "Lie-flat seat in usiness class in the most comfortable seat I have ever sat in—on or off a plane. Cathay service is remarkably good and caring, but not intrusive." Cons: "Dinner entrees not as good as last Flights with Cathay, but dim sum for breakfast was excellent." Cons: "The delay of one and a half hour has resulted in a loss of half a day of holiday. Without any compensation." Pros: "Efficiency and on time takeoffs." Cons: "FILTHY bathrooms, sinks wouldn’t drain, floors weren’t kept mopped. Truly disgusting." Pros: "Actual plane was in good condition and as comfortable as a plane can be. Very good selection of in flight entertainment." Cons: "Flight attendants were rude and made you feel that you were bothering them. Beverage offered twice in 15 1/2 hours. Beverages when available if you want to ask the flight attendant, but again, they were definitely put out when you asked them. Caroline wasn’t kept clean throughout the 15 1/2 hours- i’m accustomed to light attendance walking through the isles periodically to get customers garbage regular league so that it doesn’t build up." I liked when we actually were allowed to get on the airplane back to Edmonton… What could’ve been better well, not having our flight be delayed five hours could’ve been better… And then canceling our flight from Edmonton to Toronto, and then rescheduling us to fly from Honolulu to Edmonton -Edmonton to Vancouver, and then Vancouver to Toronto with a 12 hour layover in Edmonton pretty much was hell… Total travel time to get home 38 hours that’s really what could’ve been better. The two gate attendants for WestJet in Honolulu told us to come back to the gate to try to make other arrangements because they had to board the Calgary flight 1st and they didn’t have time to talk to me but by the time I came back when they told us to they said you should’ve come earlier to make these arrangements everyone else already changed their flights… We found out later that 30 people did not get on the 2:30 AM Edmonton flight. They ended up getting on the midnight flight to Calgary and making other arrangements to Toronto and so forth which we could’ve taken advantage of that if they had allowed us to when I initially had went up and approached the two gate attendance one of their names was Denise. One of the kindest WestJet employee was the one who received us in Edmonton, who felt so bad about the entire situation she got us for more meal vouchers and flew us first class from Vancouver to Toronto. In Honolulu they had given us two vouchers to use for dinner and they weren’t valid outside of Canada so we had purchased a meal and they were completely useless… But nowhere did it say that they could only be used in Canada So when we received more food vouchers in Edmonton, all of them did end up working in Canada, but it was just so convoluted. Overall, we have traveled to other countries even going as far as Africa… and that experience was far easier than flying to Hawaii from Canada I cannot believe any of this happened and how inconvenient it was We arrived, exhausted after 38 hours of travel, and could not even go to work on Monday. I look forward to hearing from KAYAK or from WestJet for some sort of compensation over the situation. Flight was good, long lay over, but that was likely my fault Low cost flight so no movie screen. Minimal food- coffee and a biscuit. 3 hours long so no issue with this. The plane was dirty and parts were broken. Really run down. My table kept falling down because the latch was broken. Flight attendants were just plain old mean. Don't waste your money going to Canada unless you absolutely have to. It's a hellhole. Pros: "The pilot got us to Toronto." Cons: "Everything. Contrary to most of my experiences with WestJet over the past nineteen years, this was the worst, overall, trip I have ever had with them, from delays, to missing my connecting flight, to gross incompetence with the staff, to a failure to even empathize with our situation (with a baby!)." Pros: "A flight is a flight, nothing to write home about - a mode of transportation." Cons: "Weather and deviated disarrangements tainted our vacation." Pros: "Very kind. Gave my daughter an extra snack because we had not had a solid meal in a while." Cons: "Boarding process is never good. Obviously need to board the plane from the back to the front in reverse numerical order." Cons: "Flight was delayed 2 hours, then at the gate boarding didn’t start till 10 mins before take off. Took off almost an hour after the delayed take off time." Pros: "Comfortable seats. Nice staff." Cons: "Poor entertainment. I usually watch movies on my iPad but there was no wifi and the available TV shows were not to my taste, the screens were small and not clear. The magazine was boring, no games to play. Flight delayed an hour for no apparent reason." Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "I booked a flight for Tuesday the eighth and you guys changed it to the seventh, this has never happened to me before I am furious!" Lufthansa may just wait in Munich for 11 hours. Our flight to Marseille should’ve been at 11 AM but we did not leave you like until almost 10 PM. I will never fly Air Canada or Lufthansa again. Air Canada needs some competition on routes to Toronto. They are too big to care I really disliked the boarding procedure, especially the person at the counter before boarding who handled getting us in. She specifically asked me to check in my carry on luggage and gave me no other options. I asked her if I was able to even try to fit it in the overhead compartment but I wasn’t given a choice. There was space when I got inside the plane to fit my luggage. But I felt pressured and did not feel valued as a aeroplan member customer as she had demanded this to be done as I was boarding. Very disappointed and frustrated as the flight had already been delayed for an hour. Long time for luggage to show up. I know pearson is short staffed but it was a long time. Cons: "The plane was loaded front to back and unloaded without any disipline i.e. the usual uncontrolled mob. Neither is a good idea in this time of covid-19." Pros: "Air Canada's fights to and from Regina to Milwaukee are way to long" Pros: "Aair Canada rouge seems to ne a plane for cattle. Too tight" Cons: "Human space between seats" Pros: "The in seat entertainment." Cons: "The seats were uncomfortable and very small. No offering of water or soda other then the one time." Cons: "Cancelled one flight, then delayed another one because they were waiting for a pilot. They offered very little help, citing that they couldn’t control the weather, meanwhile WestJet is finding & paying for rooms, shuttle buses and taxis to make the delay more tolerable and less stressful. We could only watch and wish we were flying WestJet." Pros: "The crew was sweet and friendly." Cons: "When one is trying to watch a movie, you can't hear anything. The connection was very very poor." Cons: "Flight delayed. Did not have service till an hour + into the flight as someone was sick and all staff was attending to that situation. Luggage was 30+ minutes delayed. Ugh, I had my pick up constantly having to circle the pu area!" Pros: "Flight was faster than expected." Cons: "Stuck with a window seat next to a couple on a group tour. She spilled into my seat so we kept jockeying for better comfort next to each other." Pros: "Nothing. I will never fly United again. The only reason I booked this flight was because i thought it would have the kind of good service I’ve experienced before on Lufthansa." Cons: "There was a 1 hour layover prior to the DC flight. Frankfurt’s security line was so slow that it caused us to almost miss our connection to DC running thru the airport. To add insult to injury, the United gate attendants were so incredibly rude and inconsiderate when we explained why were delayed." Pros: "Nice and clean than past old metal." Cons: "Close captioning or English subtitling didn’t work with the app." Cons: "Seating very tight. Difficult to get in and out, or to get your things from under the seat." Pros: "Crew did the best they could." Cons: "Flight was repeatedly delayed and until it became impossible to make my connection. Everything is rebooked and I haven’t left yet." Pros: "The crew was nice and very respectful to all the passengers." Cons: "Comfier chairs" Cons: "The fact that United forces basic economy customers to check carry-on luggage is nothing but a cash grab. Some of the overhead compartments were completely empty yet they force you to pay ?30/ bag. They also gouge you an extra $25 per bag if you bring your carry on to the gate." Cons: "It was one of the worst trips i have taken. The delay was beyond real and they informed us of it 10 min prior to planned boarding eventhough they knew of the snowstorm all day. We boarded at 11:30pm and spent 3 hours in the plane with minimal updates. Nerve wrecking and missed an important meeting" Pros: "Large plane, quiet ride." Cons: "Staff was rude to my wife and very useless. Our bags were dropped off together, but only one made it home. We still don’t have the missing luggage."
