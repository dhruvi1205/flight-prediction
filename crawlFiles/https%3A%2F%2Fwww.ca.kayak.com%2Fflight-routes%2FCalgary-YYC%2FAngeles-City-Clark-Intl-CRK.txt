They were friendly and kind. Very helpful. Made sure I was comfortable and made sure the area was clean and safe."Read more about Korean Air Pros: "Crew was amazing. They were friendly and kind. Very helpful. Made sure I was comfortable and made sure the area was clean and safe." Pros: "Staff upgraded me both ways to an emergency exit row with more leg room." Cons: "Breakfast was just so-so, not enough snacks or drink service throughout. The departure from the plane took over an hour (JFK’s fault, not Korean Air)." Pros: "Nice, clean efficient. Comfort was good." Cons: "The crew was great but pretty impersonal. Not a great selection of movies." Pros: "extremely friendly and helpful staff, the ability to choose from three options, the included hotel stay between flights, modern planes," Cons: "none of the film choices really appealed to me, but I am picky!" Pros: "The crew, as always, was super professional, friendly, helpful, and efficient. The plane was neat and clean, I was pleasantly surprised with personal items like tooth paste, tooth brush, and slippers. And I was thrilled that you served wine with food as well. That goes a long way!" Cons: "I didn’t rate comfort and food as “excellent” as I did other items not because they were not great, but flying on an economy class for 14.5 hours, I can’t force myself to speak too highly about these two items, which doesn’t necessarily reflect my flight experience or Korean Air quality!" Pros: "I liked sleeping" Cons: "The flight attendants don’t understand English well so asking for water or some items I was completely ignored. To make up for lack of WiFI actually the entertainment system is awful. They ran out of food items and did not return to replenish drinks or remove waste" Pros: "Crew was very attentive. Even though the flight was delayed, we got to our destination earlier." Pros: "This was the big league of airlines. Great staff, presentation, service, food, entertainment. Felt appreciated as a customer during the entire experience." Cons: "Extra checked bag fee was very costly, nearly $100.00 (CAD)." Pros: "Great service. Seamless Transfer at Incheon aurprot. Courteous and helpful staff" Pros: "Crew, Food, Boarding, Entertainment." Cons: "My husband and I sat in row 30 (center & aisle). I sat in the center. As soon as the plane took off, we all heard a dog bark nonstop. The lady directly in front of me had brought a dog!! We felt terrible for the person to the lady's left and right. And then in the middle of the flight her dog pooped all over the floor! And the poor Stewardess' (they were SO wonderful) had to clean up the mess. Then the lady had to clean up more pee and poop and left all that mess right in front of my feet and handbag (which I put under the seat)! I had to hold onto my handbag and shoes the entire trip bc it was touching the pile of dirty paper towels! I couldn't eat the meal due to the gross situation, and I was very upset about this situation all bc of this one lady who had no regard for the ppl around her and behind her! I don't know what your policies are concerning bringing a dog on a plane, but it ruined my flight. I love Korean Air, and love the service and the stewardess' professionalism and attentiveness, but this has made me think twice about flying anywhere on Korean Air!" Pros: "Crew was excellent.." Cons: "For the passengers who have to go through for long hours layovers, airport must provide the access of lounge or hotel otherwise where the passengers will stay for 12 hours? The rule should be applicable for the passengers who upgrade to the Business class" Pros: "Inflight entertainment was superb, catering in main cabin was also excellent. The crew was friendly and professional." Cons: "Main cabin seats were definitely better than other airlines, but still not the most comfortable for 8+ hours." Pros: "The crew helped us move into a row that had an extra seat thus making the journey for us and our neighbours comfortable." Cons: "More food service would be helpful. There were limited snacks(mostly containing chocolate or candy - which I did not prefer) and only bananas as fruit. Could have used oranges or apples for the kids." Pros: "Everything" Cons: "Too much children ob the plain and they are crying" Pros: "Great food. Had my own row, very comfortable. Kind and helpful crew. Amazing entertainment options." Cons: "I was overcharged for the fare. I was shown a fare for $627 n got charged $688.00. why?" Pros: "I had really high expectations for this trip but they were unmet. The service was indifferent. The chair wasnuncomfortable. The aisle was super narrow. I was bumped the entire flight. I didn’t like the food. And it was obvious by the end of the trip the staff was just done. Leaving the plane I passed several attendants and they did not say anything. They didn’t thank me for my business. They did t say goodbye or encourage me to come again — they were oblivious and no caring." Pros: "Staff was courteous, even to some (1) unruly person at check in." Cons: "Hello- The system for online checking was down (I think) it took a lot of time to check in. By the time we got to passport control, there was a huge line and an hour and half was left before take off. Anyways we joined the line. Half way through, 45 min before flight (flight was eventually delayed for an hour I think but we did not know that at the time) we realized that we were definetly going to get late and were looking for any Emirates person (whilst in line) who could guide us. Eventually someone did came and told a group (some way ahead of us) that people flying to Lahore and Karachi can go to another office for passport control (we ran to that office). I believe instead of sending 1 person to a line of say 300+ people to fetch for people for Lahore and Karachi can devise a contingent plan for these kind of situations. Maybe use a hand held digital board asking passengers with Flight no:XXX to head to a place so and so. Maybe megaphone can be used. Instead of passenger anxiously trying to get to 1 person whilst keeping in line to get some important information. In flight I used the button twice to call a crew member for some juice and water. But nobody came. But that might be understandable as there was a lot going on some 1 hour after dinner I think and is not a big problem. Don't know what kind of coordination they have with Dubai airport staff, seemed least bothered." Pros: "Food as requested: Great Entertainment:great Crew: Nice 16 hrs flight didn’t seem boring at all" Cons: "Usually, on the night flights you get a small toileteries kit with ear plugs, eye cover and a toothbrush. I kind of missed that..." Korean Air8.7 Emirates8.3 Book cheap flights from Calgary to Angeles City Recent one-way flight deals Only flying one-way?
