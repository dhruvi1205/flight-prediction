Pros: "They were very generous with food and drinks. It was a pleasant flight." Cons: "Our seats were uncomfortable. We did not like sitting on the front row three deep. We would have preferred the extra legroom seats we had on the 1st flight" Pros: "Ok boarding, plane was new, entertainment system was up to date" Cons: "Premium economy service is even worse than economy as crew is never around and busy in economy. Seats are bigger but not really comfortable. Food is same as economy. Doesn't worth it to buy premium economy." Pros: "Excellent" Cons: "No complain . It’s singapore airlines and not dirty air India or jet Airways" Pros: "Being one of the best airlines in the world, you can really go wrong with these guys. Always a good experience."

Cons: "Impatient Caucasian passengers trying to squeeze past. Maybe put them further back next time! :-)" Pros: "Very good service" Cons: "Very poor entertainment. Upgrade options at the transfer desk not very clear and the staff present there not courteous" Pros: "I dropped my scarf and only realized after I was seated. People were still boarding and I told a young man attendant and he found it and brought it to me. And he was such a gentleman too! Wish I knew his name but it was Frankfurt to JFK 835am flight on April 3rd. Thank you again!" Cons: "Only the space was lacking...not a lot of room for such a long flight and having to sleep. But it was okay!" Pros: "The crew was nice, the food was good. We did miss our first flight, so we were automatically rebooked on a new flight." Cons: "We missed our first flight because of our connection." Cons: "Terrible service. It’s a nightmare to fly with. And I have a baby with me that even worse to fly with Eva." Pros: "Eva does a great job, nice personnel, good food...probably better than most." Cons: "More leg room. (My usual complaint,) Premium Economy Very Nice, but at a premium price. I flew once...nice to be offered a glass of Champagne once seated!" Pros: "The seat was comfortable. The crew was very nice." Cons: "Keep doing the same. Cost is not always the most important."

The second flight I had raw veggies which was much better, B-." Cons: "The flight from Taipei to BKK too off 40 minutes late. When we arrived in Thailand it took 20 minutes to get the jetway working. Sad! Timely flights and support services are expected." Pros: "EVA isn't a discount airline. Being the National Airline of Taiwan and a member of the STAR alliance, you will pay a premium price. I was originally being put in a row right behind the bulkhead with no individual monitor and a seat that was extremely cramped because of the tray table. I knew that I would be able to hang for a 13 hour flight and fortunately, the flight attendant was able to move my wife and I." Cons: "Only one current movie available. Food was bland and not very appetizing." Pros: "EVA crew was wonderful and hardworking" Cons: "Did not like our seats and weight limits for carry on" Pros: "I’ve always had a great flight with them. Crew always very nice and very helpful." Cons: "I have nothing bad to say. Maybe it there was a little more entertainment more movies and tv shows." This flight was packed and undercrewd! Service cart cam by twice on a 14 hour flight Qatar said few times that the luggage will be at the final destination but they were wrong. Please check where your port of entry is at the destination. This is where the luggage would be. The food was terrible. We encountered a glitch when we tried to board the flight because our boarding passes had been printed by Qatar Airways in Jakarta. Those were not recognized by Alaska’s system also we had to step out of line and have new boarding passes printed. We were stranded in bus for 10 min waiting for baording..Specially when you are traveling with kids and long previous flight. Flight has no information regarding time to destination. Wish to have screen for international travels. Pros: "The crew was amazing. I upgraded to business class and am so happy I did for the 16 hour flight." Pros: "Entertainment, crew was very hard-working." Cons: "Economy seats are way too tight, had severe problems with knee room when seat in front was reclined. A terrible passenger just forward of me had no regard to this issue and refused to be cooperative. Food was lukewarm at best and was on mildly appetizing in economy." Pros: "courteous service and a clean modern airplane" Cons: "The sound system was inadequate on the TV and the headsets were uncomfortable. The queue at the check-in needs to be better controlled, it was a bit chaotic." Pros: "Flight was 80% empty, but it was amazing anyway, slept through most of it" Cons: "Staff constantly woke me up for snacks and drinks, which is good on one hand but I was sleeping so deep that it was a bit annoying." Pros: "Food and entertainment was fine." Cons: "Crew was not very organized or helpful. Need more training/experience." Pros: "Food and flight attendants were excellent in Business Class" Cons: "Sitting near bathrooms was a bit noisy and difficult to sleep" Not exceptional but all good. Business class seats are like the domestic Mint class on Jet Blue. Comfortable but not exceptional. Food is good but not superb. Flight attendants were better on India leg than Miami to Zurich. All India staff was more professional and service oriented. Very polite and service with a smile. Pros: "Crew was great! Food was actually very good! However seats are very tight in the economy class...I’m 5’6” and 130lb and had a hard time during the 10,5h transatlantic flight.."

Pros: "The food was the best I've had on any airline in recent times. On the first flight it was a croissant and a swiss chocolate, on the second flight it was a hot danish pastry." Cons: "The first flight was late so I was worried I'd miss my connection (however connection was delayed too so I made it). Also, I was asked to check in my bag because "the aircraft was full" however when I got on the plane I noticed it was half-empty and there would have been ample overhead room." Pros: "Check in agent was extremely helpful in expediting both me and my bags after a late check-in. Flight attendants very friendly and helpful, food excellent. If Swiss Air flew everywhere I need to go, I would fly them every time!" Pros: "Great airline overall!" Cons: "No leg room due to the airplane box under the seat in front of me. Very difficult to straighten legs out, difficult to get comfortable." Pros: "Ground Staff (your frontline) were welcoming The seats are most comfortable, the cabin immaculately clean, the Staff polite, helpful and efficient. The flight was smooth including takeoff and Landing Thank You All" Cons: "Have no complaints." Pros: "The crew was excellent. They were very efficient and went about their duties without disturbing the passengers." Pros: "Crew was good. Very polite. The plane was old. No place to charge your phone. The in flight screen required the use of a remote which was inconvenient when having to wake up my neighbor to pull it out of the armrest. Food wasn’t great. Skipped the last meal service. It was like flying 20 years ago. Not bad, but not as good as it could be nowadays." Pros: "Left on time Crew friendly and helpful" Cons: "Uncomfortable seats, half of the toilets not working for portion ao flight. Entertainment system not working properly on many seats" Pros: "Very well organized company beginning with the website, check in, boarding and the flight." Cons: "None" i saved my points for more than 10 years in anticipation of treating myself to an upper class fight to and from london on virgin atlantic. i was shocked to find what you consider “upper class” on the dreamliner. it was, at best, a mediocre business class accommodation. it was tight and not that comfortable, with nearly no personal storage. everything was cramped and just generally disappointing. once i lucked into a 1st class upgrade to europe on lufthansa - a magical experience that found me reluctant to sleep, lest i deprive myself the joy of their setup. i expected something similar from virgin atlantic, but i could not have been more wrong. it will be the same arrangement on my flight home, but at least i know what (not) to expect. to be clear, this is only in reaction to the physical accommodations. your people were, and always are fantastic. I didn’t like that I had to be pulled aside to be searched in front of people like a criminal. Even if you had to search people create a room no in front of people. It’s not decent at all. I love to fly with virgin always. Pros: "The seating in upper class is unconventional and uncomfortable." Cons: "Reconfigure seating in upper class. We will no longer be customers for that reason alone.." Pros: "such a big difference in size of aircraft, very comfortable and great crew." Pros: "Everything was easy" Cons: "Business class seats are snug for big people compared to other airlines" Cons: "Overall, I am disappointed in Kayak for listing my round trip flight as KLM, when in actuality, only one short connection of this flight was actually KLM. My itinerary said KLM all over it, but in the fine print it said "operated by Delta." This is dishonest and misleading." Cons: "The food is not very good at all. One mediocre meal served soon after take-off, then for the rest of the flight tasteless, cardboard pasties and wraps." Pros: "- Special meals available for those with dietary restrictions. - Friendly cabin crew." Cons: "- Boarding kept getting delayed without any warning. - Duty free purchase was meant to be collected just before boarding the plane but mine was not there. This was not so much an issue but the man said he would have my bag sent to my seat and I was subsequently approached by a crew member who asked for my receipt. Which he was holding in his hand. I would have thought it would be quite easy to confirm the person without them having the receipt as the their name and seat number is on the receipt but he had to go back and check if it was okay. - Found it hard to sleep on the overnight flight due to uncomfortable seats. Would probably not be an issue in upper class. - No comment on entertainment as did not use it." Pros: "I loved the food and the amount of it. There were so many movies and tv shows and music to choose from!" Cons: "The seats weren’t comfortable enough for me to fall asleep." Pros: "Crew were friendly and courteous" Cons: "Poor drink selection. Food mediocre. I felt like I was in the living room of the Beverley Hillbillies. Loud people, dressed like slobs. No manners" Singapore Airlines8.6 EVA Air8.5 Qatar Airways8.2 SWISS8.0 Virgin Atlantic8.0 Book cheap flights from Seattle to Mumbai Recent one-way flight deals Only flying one-way?
