Cons:the room is a lot smaller than it looks in photos A 7.1 Good Anonymous, Dec. 2018 Pros:The staff is great, very friendly and helpful. Nice common area with plenty of seating and a couple couches. Rooms have nice windows that open and rooms stay dark with curtains drawn, so it's good for sleeping. Cons:Bathrooms are old and smell a little moldy. There was one outlet to use in the room which has 4 beds in it, they should add a power strip for more outlets and a small light by each bed would be nice too. An additional mirror outside of the bathroom so people can still finiish get ready when someone is in the bathroom, I stayed in an all female dorm and was surprised there was not another mirror.
