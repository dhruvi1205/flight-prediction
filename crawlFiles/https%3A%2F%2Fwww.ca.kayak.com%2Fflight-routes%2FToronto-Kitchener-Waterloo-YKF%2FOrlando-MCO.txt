I would fly West Jet for all my flights. Seats were comfortable and leg room was good. Slight delay for boarding but nothing too bad. Would fly with them again. Flight left an hour late while waiting for a crew member. No in flight entertainment. Sat beside a huge dude, which was a little uncomfortable 😅 Cons: "Everything was great. Westjet is so much better than Air Canada!" Cons: "Minor point. They boarded the plane very early. We got to the gate 1/2 hour before departure, and were almost the last ones to board." Cons: "The flight was full and my carry-on had to be checked due to other passengers bringing oversized carry-on. The beverage service did not occur until 10 minutes before landing. Options were limited to water only. The flight was extremely rough and the pilot slammed the plane on landing." Pros: "Could not tap opinion on previous page. Good trip. Good service. Good legroom which was covered." Cons: "Food prices." Pros: "Great crew, on time, could charge my iPad, 2 beverage services, just an awesome job! Oh biggest - NONSTOP!" Cons: "Can’t think of anything!" Pros: "Crew was good, flight itself was smooth and uneventful" Cons: "Plane was full and very cramped. I am a small person and felt uncomfortable! A crying baby the entire trip and a screaming grade-schoolers who’s parents ( or crew) never told her to please stop screaming. A big headache when I arrived in LA. It felt like a 6 hour flight!" Pros: "Simply took 4 mins and I was away !" Cons: "Everyone was great that I dealt with West Jet is great !"
