Since the gate agent said the flight was full and there would be limited space for carry-on bags, being one of the first on the plane was nice. The leg room (I'm 6'2") was good." Cons: "The crew only did one pass through the cabin with soft drinks. Perhaps because it was a red-eye? Anyway, on a nearly 5 hour flight, I would have liked more than one small cup of refreshment."Read more about Alaska Airlines Pros: "Even though I was in Group C, I was one of the first to board (Groups A, B, and C were called to board all at once). Since the gate agent said the flight was full and there would be limited space for carry-on bags, being one of the first on the plane was nice. The leg room (I'm 6'2") was good." Cons: "The crew only did one pass through the cabin with soft drinks. Perhaps because it was a red-eye? Anyway, on a nearly 5 hour flight, I would have liked more than one small cup of refreshment." Pros: "The flight delayed but the crew was really helping! Huge thank to the lady served in the economy class AS2239 on March 4th from Vancouver to Seattle. I was not able to catch the next flight without her helping." Pros: "none" Cons: "Cause the flight was canceled I have to call the airlines to get the refund, which not 100% refund, it makes me disappointed" Pros: "Plane was clean, spacious, entertainment system was great, lots of food offerings. Will fly this airline and aircraft again!" Pros: "I liked that when due to a medical reason, I was able to be given the option of rebooking my flight even though there would be a penalty and extra charges and I would need to pay the difference." Cons: "When I called to rebook my flight within the year and about 3 months in advance of the desired date, unfortunately Latam made multiple errors and also told me that rebooking flights only are eligible for more expensive flights. Even though there were other less expensive flights that I was able to find and see online, they insisted the only flight available had a price difference of $4,000+ dollars. the original ticket was around $550 so this was absurd. Not helpful at all, how frustrating." Pros: "Friendly crew. Plenty to watch on screen. Flight on time. Baggage at carousel very fast. Air temperature in cabin good. Often I freeze on other airlines." Cons: "Should be choice of free snacks. Not just 2 cookies. No music to listen to. Besides handicapped and babies, boarding should be back of the plane to the front. So much more efficient!! Bathroom needs an air freshener." Pros: "The crew were very polite and helpful." Cons: "The flight was delayed for an hour and no one could explain why." Pros: "Comfortable seats" Cons: "Delayed, may of been beyond the pilots control. Scrambled seating arrangements." Pros: "The crew was terrific" Cons: "The long delay was miserable. Although we would rather be on aircraft that was running like it should. We were dead at that point in our journey and the long delay was very difficult." Pros: "Even though there was no TV screen in the headrest, we were all provided with IPads to view. The controls on the IPad were quicker than the in headset TV's. The seats were comfortable and we all received a flight packet that included a toothbrush, eye shades, ear plugs and a pair of socks for our comfort! Blankets and pillows were in our seats when we arrived." Cons: "I missed being able to see our flight path. On a long flight it's difficult to keep track of where we are and now much longer we will be in the air without the flight tracker. My baggage was misplaced, so I was delayed by needing to fill out forms for lost luggage. Thankfully, it was located before I reached my connecting flight." Pros: "Very nice people and helpful. Good attitude" Cons: "Board was a bit disorganized and took much longer than I am used to even on full planes" Cons: "Just hate the super smaller seats and the reduced spaces everywhere" Pros: "non stop flight" Cons: "Crowded, small plane. No air after people had boarded while fuel was being replenished (dangerous?), sitting at gate for 20minutes. This, after a 2 hour delay. Then a rough landing in Minneapolis- plane brakes sharply and suddenly, shuddered to a taxi rate of speed. simple snacks, not very good." Pros: "The crew was amazing, the seats were super comfortable, entertainment was great, lots of movies to choose from. Also they handed out a lot of great snacks" Cons: "The delay was totally unexpected and frustrating particularly when no bad weather around!" Pros: "The crew was great." Cons: "The flight and crew were great. But I was not able to choose my seat because I purchased an economy flight. I was very uncomfortable. But I was luck that that people that were sitting with me were great." Pros: "The crew was so nice especially the man who came to thank me for keeping my body out of the way of those who were serving and those using the bathroom. My husband an I were in the last row. He offered me a free drink, which I didn’t accept but I felt so good." Cons: "When we booked this trip via Kayak, we thought that we were booking on Westjet. Westjet knew nothing about the flight when we tried to check in." Pros: "The flight attendants were amazing. 12 people had a connecting flight and they brought a shuttle bus. You dont see that kind of service any more 10 stars for that" Cons: "Super small plane." Cons: "Passengers should have the option to ask for additional snacks." Great flight, comfort, and staff. Prefer tv in back of seat but watching on phone will do Pros: "Friendly staff and the support they offered to my mother who needed a wheelchair." Cons: "I would have liked to have had WestJet internet and entertainment access. It was not offered on our flight from Toronto to Fredericton." Pros: "The fact that military personnel and retired military personnel and their spouse can check in luggage for free. The check in crew was also very courteous." Pros: "Cheerfulness of WestJet employees." Cons: "Seat comfort; seats hard. Person next to me average size but still spilled into my seat with “man-spreading” and shoulders." Pros: "Efficient crew and reasonable seating" Cons: "Need more legroom or a device to fold passenger legs for the flight duration..." Pros: "Crew was good. Seats need to be updated and are confining. I appreciated being able to disembark through front and rear door." Cons: "More space between the seats." Pros: "the crew was very polite but the flight was too short to have a meal" Cons: "delayed embarking" Pros: "The crew were great! Ingrid was so sweet as soon as I stepped on board !" Pros: "Yes they were so great will fly again with them" Cons: "Nothing your awesome" Pros: "I was able too have ice with my water was great got dehydrated quick probably nerves" Cons: "Everything was fine" More than 40 minutes of delay, the crew even didn’t apologize or explain the reason why we are late, no service for a short flight I was served cheese that had mold on it. I brought this to the flight attendants attention and she informed her supervisor. They were apologetic and offered me a replacement, but I think that is extremely insufficient compensation given I ate bad cheese causing food poisoning for my birthday vacation. Both me and the flight attendants photographed the cheese, and I was told they’ll “put in a ticket” to ensure it doesn’t happen to someone else……. Everything went very smoothly. Only issue, my movie screen was difficult to use. Unresponsive to touch commands. The crew was EXCELLENT 👍 Very helpful and accommodating. Upon arrival in London, the process was seemless. Highly recommend! Pros: "Another exit seat and got upgraded to economy premium. Possibly one of the best flights I’ve ever taken." Cons: "It was great" Pros: "Typical low cost economy uncomfortable seats and service. Plane left over 3 hours late." Cons: "Could have informed us accurately about the possibility of making the connecting flight to our final destination. Gate we were sent to had left 45 minutes prior." Cons: "We missed our connection due to the delay and they could only rebook us on flights that made us miss an entire day or our vacation." Pros: "Terrible flight. Super tight seats. Major airport delay to take off and land. Overall not a good experience." Pros: "The flight was 1.5 hours late that almost caused us to miss our connecting flight to Tel Aviv. The service and plane was just OK." Cons: "The vegetarian meal was just fair. The plane was small and bathrooms options limited" Pros: "Good service, decent food, nice entertainment options and it's nice not to feel like the airline thinks it's doing you a favor by letting you fly with them." Pros: "We purchased seats with extra legroom and it was very, very much worth it. My husband is 6 foot four and he was able to stretch out his legs comfortably. Seats are not uncomfortable, which is different from some airlines we’ve been on, and we really like the adjustable headrest where the sides can be flipped up to keep your head from rolling around while snoozing. We like that the silverware is actually metal instead of plastic!" Cons: "The screen that folded out of the armrest was so small that watching a movie on it gave us a headache. The furst meal/lunch was so-so. Personally I would prefer a mixed fresh salad with a little bit of ham or chicken on top instead of the attempt at a hot mushy entree. The second meal/dinner was Similar to a hot pocket. The bread and the filling was pretty tasteless. Why not just have a healthy fruit bowl? Would have liked to see some English language reading material in the seat back pocket – it appeared to be only German language. Alternatively, it would be great if the flight attendants could offer non-German language reading materials upon request." I had checked in online the day before but was instructed to collect our boarding passes when we arrived. I am not completely comfortable using the automated Kiosks and always enjoy the nostalgia of speaking with someone when checking in for a flight. Upon doing so however, we were immediately asked,"did you check in online already?" To which I replied, "yes, but we were asked to retrieve our boarding passes upon arrival." She then said, "that's what those machines over there are for. We really encourage people to use those." That unfortunately sparked a series of shortness and overall poor behavior in my opinion from the woman who checked us in. I understand it was early in the morning but I am always excited to experience flying and that interaction has unfortunately left a bitter taste in my mouth to the point I will forever now hesitate to book with Porter again. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Cheers, JD Everything was fantastic, by far the best airline experience in Canada 🇨🇦! Unlike our porter connection this was great , smooth 2minutes at check in not 90 mins Food wasn’t great but it’s plane food , staff were great Pros: "Originally: a low fare" Cons: "Flight oversold, travelers bumped. Flight delayed while they kicked people off the flight." Pros: "Efficient check in. Liked the shuttle bus service from subway to airport." Cons: "As expected this is a commuter flight so very stripped down in terms of amenities. Tight plane seating and those overhead bins just barely accommodate the carry on." Cons: "The crew could have checked us in...we were 5 minutes late and had to book and pay for new tickets." Pros: "Friendly crew wick deplaning" Cons: "$35 for a carryon is ridiculous. Do you really want your peer airline to be Spirit? Quote your all in price for fares." Pros: "The crew was very attentive and the seats are comfortable. The waiting time is horrible...they are always late!" Cons: "I like landing at Billy Bishop, it is very convenient and not too crowed but lately the common lounge has gotten so crowed that you can only seat on the floor. The flights are usually 2 hrs delayed sometimes 3 or 4 hrs delayed! so never plan on having a connecting flight on the other side of your tr" Pros: "The crew was good and boarding was super efficient" Cons: "No entertain on the plane. Since when YTZ offered no more complimentary drinks and some snack?" Pros: "Very convenient, non stops and airport is close to downtown" Cons: "Captain said the 1 hour delay was due to bad weather in Washington DC but there was no bad weather in DC.
