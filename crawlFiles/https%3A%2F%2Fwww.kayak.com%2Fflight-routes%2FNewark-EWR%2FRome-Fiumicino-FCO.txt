They lost our luggage. We missed our connection from YVR to Naples when we arrived in Zurich and then we got re-routed to Rome and then Naples. We eventually got to Naples but our bags didn’t. Our experience at the lost luggage in the Naples was not at all reassuring. They didn’t seem that interested in our problem. I did a live chat with Swiss customer service and all they could do is tell me to follow the process. Meanwhile we’ve had to spend significant money on clothes and I have to replace medications. This has meant our trip so far has been totally different than what we had planned. It’s not clear that our baggage will ever show up which means we will have lost significant amount of clothing and other things and our two month trip to Europe will have more problems than good memories.

So far we are not happy. Pros: "Amazing - they had a full dinner for a 9:55pm flight, with real silverware, complementary alcohol, for economy passengers! Crew extremely professional and efficient." Pros: "Crew was very nice and attentive" Cons: "Leg room on my first flight (longest leg of the trip) was not much and when the person in front of me leaned their chair back, my knees were touching the chair." Cons: "1.5 hour delay departing put a slight damper on this flight but otherwise it was fine." Pros: "The crew was great! The entertainment was pretty good too." Cons: "The cabin was WAY too warm." Pros: "Crew was kind and gracious." Cons: "Hand carry was checked 3 different times. Goes to show that Swiss staff doesn’t trust its colleagues to determine if the bag passes muster." Pros: "Food was good. Crew was kind and gracious." Cons: "Seats were extremely cramped. Once the person in the front reclined their seat it was very difficult to get out of the seat. Also better guidance is needed during boarding. Finally, my hand carry was checked 4 times by 4 different people, which means your staff doesn’t trust their own colleagues." Pros: "The space of the seat is wide. Nice chocolate." Cons: "First, they announced that they need some passengers to voluntarily give up the booking in exchange for 280 refunds (a slightly higher rate which not worth to do it) and 1 stopover the fight to Rome which will arrive at 22.00 instead (our flight is 17.35). About 15 minutes before boarding time, they announced flight delaying. Around 17.45, they announced gate changing from B to A which located at opposite side of the the airport so all passengers run there because of everyone afraid that their booking might be canceled because no one agrees to give up. At both gates, many people try to jump in the queue which no staff comes in the manage the queue. During waiting on the board, the air condition seems to be closed, hard to breathe. Around 19.00, the plane took off the Zurich airport eventually, finish the 1.5 hours delay. The captain announced that it cause by the technical problem of the flight earlier but my thinking it cause from over-booking." Pros: "There was too little space between rows. Sometimes it was too difficult to watch a movie because the screen was too close to my face." Cons: "Despite listing items desired for breakfast per seat assignment, flight attendant still got it wrong." The restrictions regarding carry-on baggage is too strict. My wife was forced to check her carry-on bag. Never had this on other airlines. Pros: "Plane was clean. Staff helpful" Cons: "We booked our seats online and later at check in received boarding passes with totally different seats. Ordered kids meals and was informed that they dont have any for our kids :(" Pros: "Crew was fantastic and with an exceptional service. Food was really good." Cons: "Maybe the seats coudl be a little bit wider" Cons: "The Austrian airlines website is absolutely the worst and least user friendly that I've seen for an airline. I tried paying for my bags and it rejected half of the itinerary's bookings for no reason. It took a ton of clicks to get stuff done and I kept getting errors. Very limited movie selection." Cons: "The food was so cheap... pasta and a muffin. I’ll be looking around for another airline." Cons: "The crew dropped the bottle to the head of my son." Cons: "Hand luggage not allowed onboard due to being just a bit oversized -- just its wheels only. Never had this problem with the same luggage with other airlines, only with Austrian." Pros: "Fast flight , friendly staff , ok food" Cons: "I couldn’t push my seat back and because of that I was awake the whole flight (night flight)" Pros: "From start to finish there were no hiccups. It was a pleasant journey." Pros: "Everything was awesome best flight i had in my life." Cons: "Nothing" Cons: "This Lufthansa flight was operated by United Airlines. Coach seating was uncomfortable after a couple hours despite moving around regularly." Pros: "The flight crew & the flight itself was great." Cons: "The flight was delayed by 4 hours. Not only did I miss my connecting flight, but I also missed my rescheduled flight. I had to wait another 7 hours in the airport waiting for a flight. And due to this I missed an important meeting." Pros: "Friendly staff. Free drink and snack. Comfy seats and very easy boarding process" Pros: "The flight attendants were wonderful." Cons: "You take a bus to reach the plane and the seats are uncomfortable without any entertainment systems. Thankfully the flight was only 1.5 hours." Pros: "Great crew, food, entertainment and drinks." Cons: "Only thing that could be improved is comfort. They provide a small pillow and blanket, but even with those, it is very difficult to sleep." Cons: "On our layover in Munich, we were at our gate, then noticed about 30 minutes prior to boarding that they’d moved us to another gate quite far away, so we hurried to the new gate, only to discover the change was an error, and we had to run back to our original gate. Made it, but annoyed." Cons: "The flight was delayed several times and we were kept waiting at the gate without knowing when exactly we will leave." Pros: "This space intentionally left blank" Cons: "For starters, they sat my 12 year old daughter 6 rows away and both of us in center seats so no one would switch with us. Mid flight, my daughter asked to switch with me since the guy next to her kept asking personal questions and was making her uncomfortable. Second, the in flight entertainment did not work. Third, I had pre-ordered a diabetic meal, they “think they may have given it to someone else.” Fourth, one hour delay making for a tight connection. And finally... they lost my suitcase. Should arrive in a few days." Pros: "The efficiency and kindness of the flight attendants made the trip enjoyable. The water service really helped with dehydration. Also, the food was EXCELLENT, which you don't often hear on a flight. My seat was comfortable and the movie and television selections was great. Will ABSOLUTELY fly with them again!" Pros: "It was overall a great flying experience." Cons: "One of my connections was way too short. I almost missed my flight. I had to run!" Pros: "Amazing crew, fast boarding." Cons: "Uninspired food. I was served the same meals 30 years ago." Pros: "All good." Cons: "Gluten free meal was selected and paid for before the flight, but for some reason the crew didn't have the option available for me once on board. Nevertheless, they tried to be their best. More drink's without extra charge. Follow Lufthansa service and all will be grand." Pros: "Great food, typically on time and very prompt. entertainment was good. It was an older plane so the actual screens and monitors or outdated." Cons: "There were several babies crying for at least 2/3 hours and of course it is not the fault of the crew or airline. But that definitely left a lot of people dissatisfied with an overnight flight in which we are hoping to rest before arriving in Copenhagen. Seats are getting smaller and smaller. Spaces are very tight but that seems to be the norm with all airlines" Cons: "Upon landing in EWR on United, per my reservation on this site my connection was on SAS to Copenhagen. Upon arrival in EWR, I received an email from this site saying my SAS flight "may be canceled". I immediately headed to the terminal where SAS was and went into the lounge to speak to an agent. The women I spoke to could not have been more rude. She told me my flight was canceled and that she did not have access to any details because that was United's responsibility. I told her that could not be the case because my flight was on SAS so if they canceled the flight, I would like to understand what my options are given that I had a tight window upon arrival into my final destination into Dubrovnik so I could not be too late in landing outside of my original reservation. She told me that I had to talk to United and did not even acknowledge why there was a cancellation or anything other than the SAS flight I was on was cancelled. She barely even helped me to understand where my luggage was which I was very concerned would be lost given the issue with the flight cancellation. As a result of all of this, it turns out I was put onto a United flight that now had MORE connections. I had to now go to Frankfurt to Vienna to Dubrovnik, all with really tight connections AND now I no longer was on the same flight as my friend who I was traveling with. SAS did not help with any of this or care to assist in ANY way. They told me it was out of their hands and I had to talk to United. AWFUL service when SAS had cancelled the flight! I had no choice but to take the re-routed flights. I ended up running to my gates and barely catching all of my connections which made for a very stressful travel experience to start my long awaited vacation. After paying the high cost I did for my flight, I am extremely frustrated with my experience as I ended up having more connections, tight connections, awful customer service and a really stressful trip. This is NOT would I would expect for how much I paid and out of the quality of an airline. I would like to receive some type of compensation for the extreme inconvenience of landing 3+ hours after my original arrival time, being broken up with my friend who I was traveling with, not being given any options for my travel, terrible customer service assistance, and no acknowledgement from SAS to help me in any way." Pros: "On time and clean airline." Cons: "Not helpful with stroller. Wanted us to sign off that they were not responsible for if stroller broke while handling it. Insane. They said it “might “ to big even though they didn’t know what measurements would be too big. We’ve flown for the last 3 years with this stroller but different airlines and never heard of such thing. (Since it’s the smallest city mini double stroller there is and folds flat- super small!) first time we flew SAS all. We didn’t sign anything and gate checked it and all was fine but some incompetent crew at check in. Not very helpful finding seats with all four of us. Put us in different rows. Could work on their customer service for sure." Pros: "The 7 hr trip to Copenhagen was rough. The seats are too close together. My knees hit the seat in front of me even without reclining. When the seat in front of me reclined the tv screen was 6” away from my face. It was next to impossible to get out of the seat." Cons: "Legroom." Pros: "Left on time. 50 minutes early in Copenhagen. Food was not bad." Cons: "TSA at EWR was ridiculous. Slow lines and very inefficient." Cons: "We arrived late in Copenhagen and I had 20 minutes to catch my connecting flight. Even though I was checked-in for the Copenhagen to Athens flight it left without me. I was then transferred through Prague to get to Athens and again missed my connecting flight through there. Now I am stuck in Prague looking for a flight to Athens and most likely will miss my next flight from Athens to Karpathos and will again be stuck in Athens because there are no flights out to Karpathos until 19 of May, 3days from now. I was physically in the Copenhagen airport and could have made that flight, I feel that since I was already checked in they should have waited for me and allowed me to board. Now I will Be missing work!" Pros: "Boarding was quick and easy. Decent amount of overhead space. The pilot was friendly. USB ports for charging phones at the seat. Free bottle of water at your seat." Cons: "No overhead fan. When flight got really hot, no way to moderate temperature. No choice of food at all, unless you are in economy plus. I don't remember the last time that a trans-Atlantic flight had at least a meant, or fish, or vegetarian dish. Usually, at least two or three dishes. On SAS, everything has to be ordered ahead of time. Some of the flight attendants were friendly, some not so friendly. No free alcoholic drinks even with dinner. Limited regular drinks - they are only served with food, aside from that you have to purchase even the non-alcoholic drinks. The food just wasn't very good, even compared to other airline food. Compared to other companies, relatively small selection of entertainment. I had considerably more choice on a domestic flight than on a 9 hr. international SAS flight. Storage pockets at the seat are pretty small." Cons: "The flight from EWR to Oslo was delayed by over 2 hours which meant I would miss my next connection... and I understand that happens sometimes. But, it was after hours on the airline number phone number and the fly.com customer service could not help with finding an alternate connection from Oslo to FRA. It was frustrating to then have to wait at Oslo airport for another 4 hours before the new connecting flight." Pros: "Flights arrived on time" Cons: "Lousy crew at checkin gate, and on plane, they try and charge you for everything" Cons: "I had to pay for my check in bag extra, which was not clear in the booking process. Very misleading!" Pros: "Great seat back screen entertainment options." Cons: "I like that they keep costs down by not including extras like in flight alcohol and food." Pros: "Was ok. Got us there but everything is a la carte" Cons: "Was ok. Newark is awful." Pros: "Iceairline has been delayed from Newark , can’t catch the connection flight from Reykjavik to Frankfurt at same day , ponsdond to next day flight ." Pros: "The flight was nice." Cons: "I didn't like the check in personal.The one older woman was very rude & I don't think I will be flying with you again." Pros: "I liked that it was non-stop. The crew was nice. They gave out a bottle of Icelandic water and pillow and blanket." Cons: "Too crowded. Not enough explanation about the plane and different comfort levels of the different seat levels. I might have paid for upgraded seat if I had understood what the conditions would be. Also there was no explanation as to whether there would be food served or not." Cons: "Our bags were not sent with us to Zurich. The airline made no attempt to keep us updated. THE HOLD TIME ON A PHONE CALL TO ICELAND AIR WAS 2 HOURS !! I rated Food as "Poor" since nothing was served!" Pros: "Water bottle" Cons: "Delay that made me miss my connecting flight, which was then rescheduled a full 24 hours later. This is cutting into my vacation and the time to see my family." Pros: "I liked the movie options." Cons: "I don’t understand how you can be on a flight for 5 hrs and all they give you is water!!!! The seats were beyond painful and the space was so cramped. There was no sleeping on this red eye. Plane noise was extremely loud and we were not by the wing. Our flight was delayed and they didn’t say a thing until it was past the time to board!!! Really?!? No apologies for it either. This is the worst flight I have ever been on. Dread getting in this flight to go home."
