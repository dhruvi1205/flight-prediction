Silverfish on floors. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Oct. 2018 Pros:I loved that even though it’s a lower level Rosen, it still had the Rosen customer service, and cleanliness. I couldn’t be more happier, the front desk was so sweet and I called to see who cleaned my room and I believe her name was Nilsa and she did such a wonderful job. I also loved the views from the 9th floor I could see downtown Orlando, universal and surrounding areas. I usually stay at higher star hotels but this one had to be one of my favorites so far and it was so affordable and free parking. C 10.0 Wonderful C, Mar. 2018 Pros:The hotel was very well maintained and clean. It has been recently remodeled, and everything seemed fresh. The staff was very nice and helpful. It is very close to Universal Studios. We could see the Volcano directly across I-4 from our room. We were on the 9th floor, and the view was great.

A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Oct. 2017 Pros:The breakfast at the palm restaurant was awesome and the service by Joan was amazing. The beds were comfortable and the staff is very helpful. Also the bartender at the bar named Ben was excellent. Cons:I would suggest to have bacon available everyday. I would also suggest on looking into making the bathrooms bigger. I also noticed the pool tables were no longer there I would suggest to replace them.
