KAYAK’s top tips for renting a car in Montreal Montréal–Trudeau airport is located about 13 miles outside of downtown Montreal with a total road distance of 18.4km. If it’s your first time in Quebec, hiring cheap car rentals in Montreal from major car agencies at the airport such as Thrifty, Hertz, and Dollar is advisable, especially if you’re traveling with children or you want to explore Quebec on your schedule. Depending on the traffic and your final destination, you can expect the total travel time from Montréal–Trudeau airport to the city to be between 45 minutes to an hour. Upon arriving from Montréal–Trudeau airport, hiring Montreal car rentals makes it easy to embark on some of Quebec’s most sought-after experiences, such as the Gaspésie road tour. The 7 to 10-day trip follows the St. Lawrence River through the Eastern Townships and Quebec’s wine regions, including the Rimouski Wildlife Reserve, Bonaventure Island, Percé Rock provincial parks, and Chic-T-Chocs Mountain Lodge. If you want to experience the history of Quebec through the relics of early settlers, you can take the one-day trip from Quebec City along the New France Route to the coast of St. Lawrence at Côte-de-Beaupré. Did you know that the Island of Montreal is the only place in North America where you can’t turn right at a red light? Just as in Canada and the US, driving cheap car rentals in Montreal is done on the right side of the road, and drivers must wear seatbelts at all times. Note that road signs in Montreal and the rest of Quebec are marked in French, so it’s worth remembering a few terms. For example, traffic will be marked as 'CONGESTION' the stop signs that are marked as "SORTIE' ‘ARRÊT,’ indicate exit,’ ,’ ‘BLOQUÉ’ means that a road is blocked, and ‘EXPY’ is an expressway. Additionally, freeways, or motorways, are called autoroutes and indicated with an ‘A’ on road signs. Fortunately for travelers looking to rent a car after landing in Montreal, the rental car desks are located right within the airport’s baggage claim terminal, meaning you don’t have to take a shuttle or bus to reach an off-site rental car center. After collecting your luggage, the signs will lead you to the rental car desks and from there it is a short walk downstairs to the rental garage. Drivers should beware that right turns on red are not allowed on the actual island of Montreal. Outside the island and in neighboring areas, right turns on red are allowed, but on the island it is strictly forbidden. Rush hour can be rough in Montreal as it has rated among the most congested cities in Canada. However, if you avoid the bulk of the morning rush hour (6:30 a.m. - 8:30 a.m.) and the afternoon rush hour (3:30 p.m. - 7:00 p.m.), then you should be fairly safe from congested streets and traffic jams. In particular, the major highways, such as Highways 20 and 40, are to be avoided during peak rush hour. Drivers should take note that intersections will often lack crossing signs for pedestrians. As such, cars are to yield to pedestrians crossing as they have the right of way. Drivers should also keep their eyes open for bikes, as biking is very popular in Montreal during the warmer months. 25% of our users found rental cars in Montreal for C$ 45 or less Book your rental car in Montreal at least 1 day before your trip in order to get a below-average price Off-airport rental car locations in Montreal are around 62% more expensive than airport locations on average Supplier choice rental cars in Montreal are around 4% cheaper than other car types, on average Montreal car rental experiences: the best tips from KAYAK users Insights shared by verified travelers who rented a car in Montreal Learn how KAYAK collects reviews and tips from users.

Why? Because a taxi can drive on a HOV lane and take you to your destination (to go get your rental car in no time at all:) Now I’m thinking everyone will know my secret 🤣 but it is good to share. Verified travelerJun. 2023 I didn´t have any problem with driving or parking and I come from Europe Verified travelerJun. 2023 Use a GPS. Highway 20 is better than the 40 for going towards Ontario. Verified travelerMay 2023 If you can, leave the car behind and use transit. The roads in Montreal are (and have always been) a disaster.

Comfortable and quiet. Cons:It was a very stressful experience returning the car. It was downtown Montreal (Place Desjardins--Blvd Rene Levesque/Jeanne Mance) and one street was blocked off for a festival. Our GPS also kept trying to take us on the opposite side of the rental office. The office was closed, so we just gave it a shot to call a hotel nearby, the Hyatt Regency. Luckily the man on the phone gave us a clear route down St. Urbain (one way street) to find the office (a small sign outside a parking garage). So call that hotel if you get lost! The office was down in the parking garage. There was no sign of where to put the car, except a space with a bunch of cars with a rope across it. We decided to just unhook the rope and park it there. It also took us awhile to find the key drop (a inconspicuous pipe with a lid over it). A sign with an indication "key drop" would be helpful.

We lost prepaid because when we finally got to the Routes off airport location (which was not clear when we made the reservation) they refused to rent because I was over their company age policy (even though I wasn’t when I made the reservation). 10.0 Wonderful Aug. 2023It was good 2.0 Poor Jun. 2023Vehicle was fine except it had litter in the glove compartment and trunk. The gas tank was only 3/4 full. Our greatest criticism of Routes is the age limitation of 71 and for that reason, I cannot rent from the company again. My 71-year old wife had to do all the driving. I am 74 and an excellent driver….I have never been turned down before and I rent in countries all over the world. It took the agent about 20 minutes to discover my age as well. I do not mind paying a bit extra for my age, so please change your policy!!! Otherwise the staff was very polite. 8.0 Very good Jun. 2023It was mostly good. It's just that they tried to charge me $80 extra for picking up the car a few minutes early. If you're not paying attention, it feels like they're trying to scam you for extra money.
