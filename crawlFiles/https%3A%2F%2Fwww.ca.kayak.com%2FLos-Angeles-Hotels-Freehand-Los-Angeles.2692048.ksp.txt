A 9.1 Wonderful Anonymous, Jun. 2018 Pros:The location was AMAZING. I absolutely loved the commodities and the ambience. The staff was so helpful too and I appreciate helping me when I needed it. Cons:The beds and the room. The bunk beds were soo small so it was hard to get comfy. I was on a small vacation so I didn't like the space. Since there hardly was any. A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Jun. 2018 Cons:Breakfast was little Toast and a muffin No butter A 2.0 Poor Anonymous, Jan. 2018 Pros:The rooftop was beautiful Cons:- staff could care less about service - rooms are soooooo tiny - you hear everything from slamming doors to talking in other rooms - it's a hostel as well with shared rooms on every floor - people can smoke inside the rooms so it smells - security is not there abs bums get into the hotel - elevators don't work - had to take the stairs almost every time - didn't feel safe in the neighborhood - save your money and do not stay here. I wish I didn't. D 10.0 Wonderful Debaba, Dec. 2017 Pros:Everything Cons:Nothing A 8.8 Very good Anonymous, Jul. 2017 Pros:Everything was so new and clean, and nice. The hotel lobby bar and restaurant were beautiful. The staff were all extremely friendly. I loved the beds in the hostel style room I stayed in—would stay in them over sharing double beds with friends/family any day. Wish more hotels used this option. Cons:Wish there were more smaller towels in the room for washing face, drying hands, to put on floor after shower, etc. Some facilities and amenities not open or fully functional yet (but should be soon), wish locks for hostel room lockers were provided, instead of charged for.
