KAYAK’s top tips for renting a car in Fort Lauderdale One of the great perks of Fort Lauderdale car rentals is that they allow you to explore much more than the local beaches. For example, Disneyworld in Orlando is about a 3h drive northwest. If you’d prefer to check out the space shuttle at Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, head north along the coast from Fort Lauderdale for about 3 h. Is a big city with lots of nightlife more for you? If so, drive south from Fort Lauderdale for about 45 mins and you’ll reach Miami. If you continue driving south from Miami for another 45 mins or so, you’ll reach the Florida Keys. Public parking garages and public beach parking as well as parking lots and on-street parking are the main parking options in Fort Lauderdale. Most require payment in cash, cards, or through phone apps. Some require permits, but those are clearly marked. The different options usually have different maximum time limits. For example, many public parking garages such as Arts & Science District Garage allow up to 12 h, whereas public beach parking such as Birch Road on E Las Olas usually allows up to 4h or so. Finally, parking lots and on-street parking in spots such as Birch Road and E Las Olas typically allow parking for up to 3h. If you plan on finding cheap car rentals in Fort Lauderdale, it’s important to pay attention to some of the regular events that may interrupt traffic. Beginning in January, this includes the Las Olas Art Fair which takes place on Las Olas Blvd. In February, Fort Lauderdale hosts its Pride festival in the city center and along the beach. In early April, the Tortuga Music Festival takes off for a few days along Seabreeze Blvd. After that, the 4th of July celebrations bring increased traffic along Las Olas Blvd. Finally, from late October to early November, the International Boat Show in Fort Lauderdale brings extra traffic into town. Fort Lauderdale is city that revolves around relaxation and simplicity, which is only magnified when you decide to give yourself the freedom of renting a car. Fort Lauderdale has beautiful beaches that provide an array of activities and opportunities to enjoy the glorious Florida sunshine. Take the opportunity to drive west to the UNESCO World Heritage site, Everglades National Park, and appreciate the subtropical environment overflowing with fauna and native animals. Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport has plenty of major rental companies to choose from, conveniently all located together in their Rental Car Center. If you arriving in Terminal 1, simply walk across the pedestrian bridge toward Concourse B and you will arrive at the Rental Car Center. If you arrive at either Terminal 2, 3, or 4, there is a shuttle bus that takes you directly to the Rental Car Center. Fort Lauderdale is situated only 21 miles north of Miami; this is an alternative flight destination that may be more convenient and affordable, as it is a larger airport. There are certain highways nearby Fort Lauderdale with tolls, including the Florida Turnpike, Alligator Alley (1-75), and Bee Line Expressway. Be careful to plan your driving route accordingly and ensure that toll payment conditions are clearly outlined in your rental agreement. Turning right on a red light is legal unless otherwise indicated. You can enjoy far fewer cars on Fort Lauderdale roads in comparison to major cities, as people are often out enjoying the glorious weather and landscapes the beach metropolis has to offer. During the evening rush hour, the I-95 Highway is the most likely to experience congestion and cause delays. Warm and sunny weather is common and cars will flock to the beaches along the coastline, so be mindful of this and give yourself extra time to reach your destination on a hot day. 25% of our users found rental cars in Fort Lauderdale for C$ 32 or less Book your rental car in Fort Lauderdale at least 1 day before your trip in order to get a below-average price Economy rental cars in Fort Lauderdale are around 84% cheaper than other car types, on average Fort Lauderdale car rental experiences: the best tips from KAYAK users Insights shared by verified travelers who rented a car in Fort Lauderdale Learn how KAYAK collects reviews and tips from users. Verified travelerSep. 2023 Yo tome el toll pass por día....pero es mejor el ilimitado ya que hoy en día los peajes son muchos!!! Verified travelerSep. 2023 Lots of traffic, not really any down time! MatthewNov. 2023 Florida drivers are aggressive. If you drive the speed limit, stay in right lane. markJun. 2023 If you are going to be on the highways, toll roads and express lanes do not take cash. The tolls are levied with license plate readers or transponders. I would recommend getting this service as express lanes and toll roads are common in South Florida. LisaJul. 2023 We drove to Orlando and back, the 450 mile cap was just enough. We did the pre-pay toll option which saved us some money. Verified travelerJun. 2023 Use your membership cards for car rentals to avoid waiting in line and watch for extra charges being added to your bill. Verified travelerJul. 2023 Driving in Fort Lauderdale is a pleasure, Miami has much more traffic. Watch for parking permit signs in Miami AustinJul. 2023 The laid back Miami vibes extend to the road! Enjoy yourself and don't be in a rush Verified travelerAug. 2023 Great service and they price is lower than the other car rental. Verified travelerJun. 2023 We had a great experience Verified travelerAug. 2023 Rent from this Enterprise location!!!! NickJun. 2023 Driving in south Florida is nuts. Lots of cars going a LOT faster than the traffic (which is already about 10 over the limit) combined with plenty of cars going well below the traffic. It's the mixing of south florida youthful energy with south florida retirement community on the roads. markJun. 2023 Pay with a visa or MasterCard and then only get the insurance that will cover the Credit Card deductible - $4.99 a day. If you do not use the turnpike or express lanes, do not get the toll coverage - which is $14.99 a day. Verified travelerAug. 2023 Driving is ok in Fort Lauderdale; pay attention to all street signs. Some areas have red light cameras which is fine. Stay out of the express lanes if you don't have the SunPass. Drive safe. AshleyJul. 2023 Make sure to ask if they have capability of having a different drop off location from the pick up site Verified travelerJun. 2023 Check the cars in and out, use your phone lantern if it is night time. MichaelJun. 2023 People drive crazy in Florida, either too slow or too fast. Verified travelerJul. 2023 Watch out for the cops and be vigilant AmirMay 2023 Make sure you are renting from the airport location and not downtown if you're flying in. And consider purchasing or bringing a toll road tag with you to avoid ridiculous extra charges if you're planning to drive toll roads and don't want to pay a ridiculous premium to either get the tag from the rental company or to get the toll billed by mail. Verified travelerMay 2023 Advise future Tesla car clients that they can only charged in a Tesla Super charge station. The car adaptor does not fit the regular charge station. Verified travelerMay 2023 You have to take a shuttle (sometimes 2 depending on the rental car company) from the airport. ShellyMay 2023 Having more options available would be nice Verified travelerMay 2023 Driving in fort Lauderdale is easy. LindaMay 2023 Sixt has GREAT value, however the off site office is very LAXED Verified travelerMay 2023 Drive carefully in South Florida since most drivers are careless.

Then on the back end I was billed an additional $100 of charges that were unclear and unexplained. I would never rent from them again. Ever. 2.0 Poor May 2021 Pros:Drop off was smooth. Cons:The price was exorbitant!!! So ripped off. By the time extra fees (no not insurance — service fees, taxes, pre-pay gas charge and a toll pass that we barely needed costing over $160) were added on our car cost about $100/day and multiplied by three weeks was outrageous. And this with only one driver. To add a second driver would have cost another $10.99/day. They took full advantage of a consumer who didn’t know the area. Car was dirty. Dollar Rental is an oxymoron. Their name should be Thousands of dollars rental.

I declined both which he then continued to ask two more times until I felt like I couldn’t say no and agreed to both. I paid $12 for the sun pass when I only went through two tolls, and paid for a full tank of gas when I used less than half of a tank.

I was stuck in Ft Lauderdale on a Friday and could not find a rental car from anyone. They were all sold out for the weekend. I felt totally helpless. I spent the next several hours trying to make other arrangements. At 3:00pm a representative from Payless contacted me and told me that they had a 12 passenger van that had just become available. The van got 10 mpg and I had a 650 mile trip ahead of me. I declined the van and continued to make other arrangements. I must say my experience was pretty awful.

SIXT should clear the prior numbers on phone hook up. Mine was full and unable to connect my phone 4.0 Mediocre Nov. 2023The staff was great and friendly and efficient but was given and upgrade I did not want because they didn’t have any cars in the class I requested. The much larger SUV I was given was very dirty, smelled inside and had body damage making it embarrassing to be seen in. It also ended up costing me a lot more in gas 2.0 Poor Nov. 2023So many hidden fees. I have full coverage they made me purchase additional coverage. Additional daily fees for living in Florida. Additional daily fees for tolls. Vehicle was no longer offered as unlimited miles. A total scam. Bait and switch. 2.0 Poor Oct. 2023It Should be disclosed that you will need liability insurance the get go ta 4.0 Mediocre Oct. 2023First they didn’t have a car ready for me and told me that I would have to wait for 1-2 hours. I told them if there were any cars available and they said no because they had sold out every car. Miraculously the gentleman appeared again and said that there was a rental available and that it would be $20 more. Since I had commitments I couldn’t cancel I had to take that. He told me he wouldn’t give me the one that was behind another car because he didn’t want to move it. And instead gave me another dodge charger that looked like it had just been returned and was filthy. The returning of the vehicle wasn’t terrible except for the fact that the man working there had a bit of an attitude. I work in the service industry and this was not a great experience for anyone. I understand many complexities of working with clients but I am not a picky or hard client to please. All around it was a poor experience. 10.0 Wonderful Mar. 2023Travel to and from the airport was on time. When we returned to drop off the vehicle we were greeted and assisted by the driver who proceeded to inspect the vehicle and to also retrieve the required paperwork from inside making the return process sweatless. Excellent staff with great energy.

Awful awful awful 2.0 Poor Nov. 2023The cancelled my reservation and were out of cars. I had to take a shuttle to a location away from the airport and it was late coming. I couldn't get anyone to answer the phone prior toy taking the shuttle. The csr wouldn't help me find another vehicle and I had to take the shuttle back to the airport and try to find another car on a holiday weekend.

Biggest issue is the misrepresentation of insurance. On Kayak I opted for additional insurance. When I get to U-Save they say that is only collision and they REQUIRE their liability which costs more than the vehicle. Only accept my insurance if it is one of their 10 approved insurers which of course mine- Country insurance is NOT on their list. None of this info on Kayaks site. At this point I am off site and in a hurry to get to my hotel, Feel very decieved. Never again 2.0 Poor Jul. 2023As bad as it could have been. Excessively long wait times for both the shuttle and then at the counter. Then they didn’t have the type of car I rented even after confirming it the day before. And all sorts of unavoidable tricks to increase the price. Terrible. Not a real car rental place. Don’t use them. 2.0 Poor Jul. 2023This company runs a bunch of scams. One is renting the toll pass for $15 a day and you have to pay for tolls. If you don't get the pass they charge you $15 a toll... How is this legal? If you use your own insurance your liability needs to be at $300000 and your not allowed to change it there. And they do a $2000 freeze on your credit. Stay away from this place. 6.0 Okay Aug. 2023They upgraded my car but the car has been damaged the whole way down the passenger side on the right side of the car. The staff were rushed so they quickly gave me the keys and paperwork and sent me off. Once I arrived to my hotel, I realized the passenger door wouldn't even open from the inside or outside. I had also purchased 3rd party insurance which said that I don't need to purchase any extra insurance from the rental car. When I went to pay, they said I needed to purchase their insurance and decided to charge me and extra $120. I wasn't very impressed with the service and I felt like I should have been given a discount for the damage. My friend that I was driving with had to sit in the back seat as we couldn't work the front passenger door. It was embarrassing to drive around with the damage. The car rental refused to change the car as the car rental agreement has already been signed. 2.0 Poor May 2023When you land at FLL you have to take a bus to the Car Rental Center. Then you have to go to another line and wait for the U-Save shuttle and get taken across town to their location. Expect an hour of walking, waiting and being shuttled around before you ever get to a car place. The first U-Save shuttle doesn’t get to the RCC until 7:30 & they don’t open until 8 and don’t answer phones before then. If you land at 6am, like we did, you are going to wait for a hour at the RCC and then about an hour at the U-Save location and probably won’t be in a vehicle until after 9. Since no employees except shuttle drivers show up until 8 and the fleet is small you will get a car returned recently that hasn’t been cleaned. They will NOT accept the insurance purchased through Kayak (and you’ll have to call Allianz and have them refund it … gives you something to do while waiting in line) & they won’t accept your credit card/personal auto insurance. You WILL have to buy their insurance. There’s no point in screaming at the one guy working the desk, like all the other customers do, he is immune to it long ago and you are trapped unless you want to call a taxi to get to a real car rental place. 6.0 Okay May 2023Cobros no especificados inicialmente Silvercar 8.0 Very good1 review Cleanliness 8.0 Comfort 8.0 Pick-up/Drop-off 8.0 Value for money 8.0 2 locations in Fort Lauderdalefrom C$ 69/day Car rental locations Locations in Fort Lauderdale 1200 N Federal Hwy +1 855 359 2227 Monday 08:00 - 16:45 Tuesday 08:00 - 16:45 Wednesday 08:00 - 16:45 Thursday 08:00 - 16:45 Friday 08:00 - 16:45 Saturday 08:00 - 16:45 Sunday 00:00 - 00:00 2900 SE 6th Ave. +1 855 359 2227 Monday 08:00 - 16:45 Tuesday 08:00 - 16:45 Wednesday 08:00 - 16:45 Thursday 08:00 - 16:45 Friday 08:00 - 16:45 Saturday 08:00 - 16:45 Sunday 08:00 - 16:45 Filters No reviews available Yesaway 8.0 Very good1 review Cleanliness 10.0 Comfort 10.0 Pick-up/Drop-off 8.0 Value for money 10.0 One location in Fort Lauderdalefrom C$ 55/day Yesaway reviewsCar rental locations Locations in Fort Lauderdale 2600 SW 3rd Ave, Fort Lauderdale +1 786 261 2517 Monday 07:00 - 18:00 Tuesday 07:00 - 18:00 Wednesday 07:00 - 18:00 Thursday 07:00 - 18:00 Friday 07:00 - 18:00 Saturday 07:00 - 18:00 Sunday 07:00 - 18:00 Filters Reviews 8.0 Very good Aug. 2023Communicate with staff was fluid.
