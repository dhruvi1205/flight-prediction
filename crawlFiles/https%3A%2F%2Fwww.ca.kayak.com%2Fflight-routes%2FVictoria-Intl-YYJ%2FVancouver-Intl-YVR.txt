Pleasant attendants, timely luggage to carousels.Read more about Air North Service was great from start to finish. Pleasant attendants, timely luggage to carousels. This airline is never a disappointment. Always on time. Short haul from YLW to YYZ , best way to travel. Boarding was fine, and flight was on time. During the flight however, you aren't even offered a drink of water. The carts never leave the galleys. All the attendants said the whole time is take your headphones off and buckle your seatbelt. For the price I wouldn't expect 5 star service, but maybe a drink would have been acceptable Nothing needs to change as it is such a short flight. The employees at the counter when we first arrived were very helpful and kind. The flight attendants were are very pleasant and helpful. I appreciated we departed on time. Pros: "Price was the best over competitors. Many dates available. Staff are friendly and service oriented. Coffee is so good. Food is great. Flight was on time." Cons: "I booked online and then had to rebook - by calling the call centre. Be good to have the ability to change flights online as well. Call centre staff was good - except I assumed she’d book us sitting in the same seats as I had originally chosen (which were available - as I checked online)." Pros: "Service was good, frequent drinks and snacks, nice little deli platter was unexpected and very delicious!" Pros: "You constantly got food and drinks served, a big contrast to the other airlines who don't even serve complimentary food on 5 hour trips. We didn't expect to get food on this 2 hour flight so we had breakfast beforehand. We were pleasantly surprised!" Pros: "Friendly staff. Provided sandwich and cookie during flight." Cons: "Minor item: Didn't provide hav charger in seats but for short flights not a big issue" Pros: "From the coffee and cookies while waiting to board to the freshly baked items given while receiving food service, this is great customer service. Not to mention the competitively priced airfare and not having to pay an extra fee for checked bags, this airline can't be beat. I would definitely fly it again and suggest it to anyone if they're looking to fly in northern Canada." Pros: "It is a no frills airline. Cabin crew were friendly." Cons: "No entertainment, no food" Pros: "Quick smooth flight. We even landed early. No delays no problems. I even had seated in an empty row" Pros: "Seat was uncomfortable because of the head rest that is attached to the seat. However the staff and crew were friendly and helpful." Cons: "Better seats" Pros: "Always a pleasure when flying with Westjet. Crew is always better than Air Canada" Cons: "Update the seats please. They are so old and there was no cushion" Pros: "The crew was polite, even with the numerous delays. Other than that, the multiple delays (3; 8:30 -> 11:30, 11:30 -> 13:05, 13:05 -> 15:30) rubbed me the wrong way and lessened my experience with West Jet. Kayak was very responsive and reliable on their end." Cons: "West Jet; the delays which took around 6 hours from my weekend trip." Pros: "Crew were very good. The economy seats were "ok". Food was good and the service was very good." Cons: "Entertainment didn't have enough new movies to watch. The leg room could've been better." Pros: "Crew was good" Cons: "I paid for a window seat, but there was no window. Contacted WestJet and they refused me a refund." Pros: "For some reason, we found ourselves in the Premium section for our return flight from Palm Springs. So we got fed!! Which was nice. And we had a little more legroom, “spare seat” between us, etc." Cons: "It was a short flight, only 2 1/2 hours, so you can’t really expect much. It’s the long flights where service really makes a difference." Cons: "Always a ‘full flight’ and they run out of spacein the overhead storage" Pros: "Great crew. Excellent flight and we were even early arriving!!" Cons: "Could not recline seat in row 30" Pros: "First time flying a turboprop. Personnel were excellent and polite and overall experience was great." Cons: "Nothing" Pros: "The crew were super great I hit my head on a over head bun the stuff were vary caring asked how I felt and will take west jet again in future travels" Cons: "Well noise was due too the plane but I got over it quick light crew were awesome was vary clean still had the new plane small intact keep up the great work west jet" Pros: "The lady was calm at the gate, explaining that we wouldn’t be leaving and trying to help everyone flipping out. 1. Flight was delayed 2. More delayed, meaning we miss connections in Calgary 3. Canceled" Cons: "While my flight was to Abbotsford, my final destination was to the US (Seattle). Canceling the flight meant I miss my 4 hour ride home from Abbotsford. When asking if I could change my final destination, only destinations in Canada would be allowed. I spent a fortune getting flights, planning rides, to make it home by the 26th and tend to responsibilities by the 27th. I realize weather delayed the flight, but once in Calgary, it would have been nice for WestJet to even scope the opportunity to get me home. #StrandedinCanada" Pros: "Friendly Staff" Cons: "Could not hear the Pilot. Emergency Exit instructions said too fast" Pros: "Great no hassle way to get to Campbell River from Vancouver." Pros: "Ontime flight, efficient check-in. Reasonable price for a 15 minute puddle jump." Pros: "Wasn’t anything to like didn’t get on the flight thxs to yall" Pros: "Courteous and helpful staff. Check in last was helpful in ensuring I knew certain details for future flights." Cons: "No earplugs on loud plane" Pros: "Airlin staff were great." Cons: "Plane was 30+ minutes late. Announcer at Port Hardy Airport was unintelligible." Cons: "They took us out to the plane then made us wait for several minutes in the rain before they would let us board the aircraft."
