Cons: "Can’t think of anything within WestJet’s control that was bad." Cons: "1. For the flight to not have been cancelled. 2. For a replacement flight within 12 hours. 3. Hotel vouchers and meal vouchers for those that could not get on a flight for longer than 24 hours post original flight! Disgusting the way passengers have been treated" Pros: "Crew was great, served us multiple times ! Even tho crew was late 25 mins. We have landed 10 mins early" Pros: "Crew was good" Cons: "I paid for a window seat, but there was no window. Contacted WestJet and they refused me a refund." Cons: "Seats were a very strange shape. They forced me to sit in a hunchback position the entire time. next to no leg room. A very tight uncomfortable space. The three hour flight was about the most I would have been able to handle. Worst seats I’ve seen in a while." Pros: "Decent flight." Cons: "Entertainment system did not work. Also they said there is USB sockets at your seat but there were none." Pros: "The on board entertainment is very good, just remember to download the westjet connect app." Cons: "Seats are ok, very cramped together, hard to get in and out of. I had picked plus seats but kayak didn't honor my selection so was forced to sit at the rear of the plane. As for the flight itself, the airliner sells only Coca Cola products, no cash purchases, credit and debit only. No free bag checks," Pros: "Great flight. It was like the plane wasnt even moving !!" Pros: "Airport counter staff v helpful. Crew were great. Helped lady with 2 kids. Looked after 1 while mom changing other." Cons: "Need more seat room. No entertainment." Upon boarding, the people at the gate were extremely rude, there were no outlets on a 6 hour international flight, there was no entertainment, all food and drink was purchase only (even snacks), and my seat reclining function was fully broken. The only redeeming quality was the flight attendants were extremely nice. This was by far the worst flight I have ever been on in my entire life I don’t know how international flights can’t have media screens to keep people entertained for the long flight. Ugh. Typical experience for budget airline. Boarding from KEF required bus transit from the gate to plane, so if you had "priority boarding" it was useless as it was simply a free-for-all when getting off the bus. But still no issues with getting our luggage into overhead bin so not really a problem. Was very apprehensive about flying Play, but the flight was fine. Nothing special, nothing horrible. Fair price to get from New York to Iceland. I wasn’t able to check in online the day before or the day of because their web configuration or business model idk. I arrived an hour early and check was closed and there was no one around to speak to and eventually was told there was no possible way to get a digital ticket despite I had no luggage to check and would have easily made it through security to boarding and had to pay for a new ticket for $330 ontop of the $169 I spend for the ticket and then I missed my rental car for $305 because I only arrived at midnight instead of noon that I was originally intended. All booked through kayak. I hope there is some kind of insurance from kayak because this was totally preventable had I not been blocked by play air from getting my check in and plane ticket. The staff was very professional, the places very clean. The legroom was a little bit tight but so worth the price of the flight. Very pleased! Next time, I want to book a stayover to explore Iceland :) The boarding process was easy, the crew was friendly and the flight was very smooth. There is a limited menu the food was tasty, but you have to purchase everything. The cost of the flight was very reasonable but everything such as baggage is extra. Play is a great budget airline. There are no TVs or chargers in the seat but there was more legroom than expected. Boarding and all staff that I interacted with were great. You have to pay for any and all drinks or snacks you might want on flight. Play is a great budget airline. There’s more legroom than expected, no TVs or chargers in the seat, all staff that I interacted with were great. Blood sucker budgeted airline. Charging after and after. No one should busy air ticket in this airline. Completely a scam and sucking blood. WestJet7.7 PLAY7.2 Book cheap flights from Hamilton to Lisbon Recent one-way flight deals Only flying one-way?
