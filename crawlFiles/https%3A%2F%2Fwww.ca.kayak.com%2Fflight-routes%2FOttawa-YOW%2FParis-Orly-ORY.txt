There were several attendants standing at the gate instructing everyone to how to scan their boarding pass. This was a slow process. It would have been much more efficient if the attendants scanned the boarding pass since they are much more efficient at it. TI would have probably saved their voices as well. Having the attendants scanning boarding passes has been a standard everywhere for a long period of time. Why change the procedure? Boarding staff, crew and food needs a lot of improvement!! It was awful Aircraft was old with minimal legspace Pros: "Nice support people" Cons: "Temperature too warm No room Couldn’t get an upgrade" Pros: "Crew" Cons: "The transfer at Frankfurt was a horrible experience. The terminal for departure was all the was at the other side of the airport. Leaving me barely enough time to transfer." Pros: "First i will say thanks to almighty God for the journey mercy, and from the pilot, the co pilots and the crew members were so amazing, such a good hospitality." Cons: "Well everything thing was so amazing so far i cant even think of anything they can do better.. from my own view" Cons: "Space is too limited even for the a small built body." Pros: "Everything, comfort, quietness," Cons: "Boarding, de-icing made us wait long on plane n it got stuffy" Cons: "No seat assigned at check-in or even as they begin boarding. I thought I was flying Lufthansa. Air Canada gate agents were condescending. Very disappointed." Pros: "Flight was on time, food good. Even the movie selection was great, but ... (see what I didn't like)" Cons: "Entertainment (sound) in seat 14K didn't work, despite 1 reboot. Please fix." Pros: "Bad" Cons: "Because the one came in from London Got Delay And I miss my flight" Cons: "It was delayed on our way to destination. Also wish it was a direct flight to ponta delgado instead of going through lisbon. It was too much back and forth." Pros: "TAP is great to fly, friendly, safe and solid, nice crew" Pros: "Food was great, seat was amazing" Cons: "Boarding was done by bus and it took too long and it want comfortable" Pros: "Crew was awesome, seat spacing comfort not so much." Cons: "Need to have seat upright to use trays to eat on flight" Pros: "The price." Cons: "Starters, main course, etc where very odd combination of flavors and therefore not at all appealing. Don't provide beverage service in Business outside of meal times. Seats good but space is restricted. Feel closed in." Pros: "The flight was smooth, and the crew very friendly." Cons: "The comfort onboard (A320) is not good: not reclining chairs, no entertainment, and horrible snack." Pros: "The crew" Cons: "Be on time and that they dont loose my bags! Wait for and extra 2 hours in the arrival airport because of the lost" Cons: "They are very sneaky and try to make you check carryon bags - for $120. Will never fly w them again." Pros: "on time, food was good" Cons: "seats are hard, painful for 7 hours..... crew was very noisy, very rough they kept hitting my arm. male crew hit the back of my seat to wake me up, he took away my food due to me sleeping." Pros: "The crew were excellent during the flight." Cons: "We missed our connection flight because our first flight was delayed. Despite getting to the desk when there were still people queuing he refused to let us board. We are now delayed for 30 hours with no money or clothes. TAP staff were horrible- no sympathy or even an apology. Just awful." Unfriendly staff, delayed flight, luggage took almost an hour. Very disappointing. One United employee a little impatient, also on flight WiFi was out for some time. I was happy to receive a complimentary alcoholic beverage for volunteering to check my carry on bag. I enjoyed everything generally. However, getting from the Tarmac to the arrival building required we got on a Bus and meaning they had to wait on everyone to get in from the plane eating a significant amount of time and we still had to get o. The air shuttle to get to the arrival building and saw passengers with connections having to run all the way. My experience flying from Ottawa to Montreal was not good! I COULD NOT GET ON THE FLIGHT BECAUSE THE AIR CANADA CHECK-IN STAFF COULD NOT CHECK ME IN NEITHER COULD THEY DIRECT ME TO THE ALTERNATIVE CHECK-IN AIRLINE I DIDN'T FLY AND HAD TO REBOOK ANOTHER AIRLINE, PORTER FOR THE FOLLOWING DAY. I NEED MY REFUND FOR THE RETURN LEG Decent room for a 6ft tall guy with wide shoulders. In flight entertainment was good for being free. I liked the map showing our location. The total experience was miserable. To much to relate the whole experience Airlines need to stop scheduling such tight connections, especially when one has to make an international connection. It puts a strain on everyone - the traveler, the airport personnel, security. Also, they lost my luggage. Seating is very tight. We were delayed 90 minutes to board, because the flight crew were late Boarding was a breeze and the attendants at the airport were very helpful Lufthansa7.8 TAP AIR PORTUGAL7.2 Air Canada7.1 Book cheap flights from Ottawa to Paris Recent one-way flight deals Only flying one-way?
