Pros: "Crew service was amazing - so diligent and courteous. They were incredibly well trained and I would rate their service level as being one of the most competitive within business class in Asia." Cons: "Seats were reasonably comfortable but not as spacious in design as in other business class cabins, so that could be a concern for some travelers. Also, I was not able to convert the main menu of the entertainment system to my preferred language so it was a bit difficult to navigate (that being said, they provided a card that guided me, so it was still usable, and the entertainment selection was good!)." Pros: "Just excellent. Excellent crew, excellent food, excellent aircraft, and excellent leg room. No recommendations." Cons: "The crew members could have been more courteous to clients on the flight by lowering their voices when conversating among themselves." Cons: "Very good airline except for the fact that the staff at Narita airport." Pros: "We were seated together as a family even though we were not able to reserved any seat" Cons: "Food could be better. Especially the easily digestible meal. It was mostly mush so it's more easily chew meal" Pros: "Crew was very pleasant" Cons: "Missed my flight due to Customs. But AA took good care of me and got me on next flight. Wish layover was a little longer. Missed flight by 10 min" Pros: "Everything about this flight was awesome. The food, the people, the seats in economy felt like first class. VERY polite and happy attendants compared to American Airlines who seemed to be annoyed by those on the flight." Pros: "The flight attendant and staff was extremely nice and accommodating. Japan airport is updated with excellent facility and flight transferring was easy." Pros: "I was comfortable, Crew was pleasant and attentive. Food was really good- both meals!" Cons: "Not applicable" Dirty plane. Urine on floor of lavatories, food was not cleaned from previous leg of flight prior to boarding, lavatories only cleaned once inflight. Boarded by group number, but did not inform passengers in terminal. So standing in line for ~40min. Pros: "Food and crew was good" Cons: "An adults only section would be great as there were a lot of screaming children on board, also seats were a bit on the small side" Pros: "Food is amazing, planes are good." Cons: "The boarding crew at the gate did not say anything while weighing the carry on bag. I was ask to go to another person who issued me check in baggage sticker and told me to hand over your baggage to a person inside. At last he mentioned to not put any valuables in that bag. My carry on bag was just 1lb extra and the first person could have told me right away and I would have thrown away chocolates and brought down the weight to permissible limit. In general passenger do carry valuable stuff in carry on bag. I had to follow whatever I was told." Cons: "Mechanical problems delayed the flight 1 1/2 hours. Other than that, the flight was good." Pros: "Supportive to my family needs traveling with 2 babies" Cons: "I was offered an upgrade to 1st class, but not to my wife, I m thankful but had to decline the upgrade.

Boarding and deboarding was the worst." Cons: "Lots to be improved. Crew food boarding on board service." Pros: "The flight was not packed so I got three seats to myself to sleep. Emirates has a lot of little touches like glow in the dark stars stuck to the cabin roof." Cons: "Couldn’t locate the call button for flight attendants and the lines to the bathroom were long." Pros: "For an economy seat, was very comfortable!! Love the food." Cons: "Online Check-in didn't work properly, so we had to check in at the airport. They were understaffed and it took us over an hour to get through check in. The customer service was horrible, and we were only allowed to bring a backpack for a carry on, forcing us to check our one carry on bag. This made our two long flights uncomfortable with nothing to change into once we landed in Dubai and still had another 8 flight to Johannesburg. The flight itself was overbooked, and we then had to place our backpacks under the seats in front of us, giving us no leg room for 13 hrs." Pros: "Overall a decent flight." Cons: "Didn’t like the boarding experience. You have somebody look at the boarding pass but then they sent us to a waiting area. The waiting/boarding area didn’t have space to make nice lines fir boarding so it was pretty haphazardly organized. You really can do better." Cons: "The crew at check in was really inconsiderate and has given us false information! Despite of what documents were required and submitted I was not allowed to board the plane."

Crew members are extremely courteous & helpful. The aircraft seats in economy class were roomy & comfortable. Bathrooms were kept clean throughout the long flight. Food was very good as was the selection of flight entertainment. Can't thi" Pros: "The crew was very friendly and helpful throughout the flight" Cons: "The boarding process in Chicago wasn’t great. Zones were not used" Pros: "Q-suits. Very comfortable and private. Great upgrade to the 777. WiFi now available for very reasonable price" Cons: "Bus transfer to Termial 5 is VERY poorly organized and takes over an hour. This makes it harder to get to Terminal 5 even if you don't have to clear security again. Seats had a bar under the padding at about the position of my hips. Uncomfortable to sleep for several hours" Cons: "I fell sick and my doctor advised against flying. Tried calling Swiss Air and JustFly.com: 6 calls back and forth and 7 hours on hold, no help. Finally got advised on driving to the airport to make the flight change at the Swiss Air counter at O’Hare. The representative told me to bring a note from doctor to switch flights. I did the next day. The same representative looked me in the eye after advising the day before and said there’s nothing she could do. Why make an elderly sick person drive to the airport again if you know already you cannot help??Absolutely terrible experience, no help from the airline or travel agency. Total loss of the full price of the ticket." Pros: "Movies" Cons: "Crew was rude to passengers. One passenger asked for extra bread and crew arrogantly commented , we dont give but ok take one." Pros: "Coach seats were comfortable but if the person in front of you reclines, your video screen will be inches from your face and it becomes difficult to get out of your seat." Cons: "Crew was not particularly friendly....almost downright rude at times" Pros: "Crew was great. Seats were uncomfortable. No air. It was extremely hot." Pros: "The inflight entertainment was great and helped to pass the time. The food was good for airline food." Cons: "The flight staff was just okay - they could have been friendlier. The seat cushions seemed old - they were comfortable enough for sitting but not comfortable to sleep." Pros: "Amazing food, There were pillows, blankets and earbuds on every seat. Really a great flight overall and I would fly with them again." Cons: "The only minor complaint was that the seats are so small that when the person in front of you reclines, you literally can’t get out of your seat." Pros: "Best food I've ever had on an airline! Great flight. Not too full." Cons: "Arm rests didn't lift all the way up on the plane." Pros: "Crew was attentive to passenger needs in a quiet way: without fanfare, did all possible to make it a pleasant, comfortable trip. In fact, went out of their way to get me a wheelchair ride to next flight, which I dearly needed" Cons: "First flight was delayed due to circumstances outside of airline’s control. They managed to get us there and help me with wheelchair, etc to make flight. Great service and kindness" Cons: "Chose the option with Swiss because it showed that a checked bag was included. Got to the airport and was told to pay up for each checked bag. Great start to the trip." Pros: "Everyone was friendly, pleasant and very helpful. Upon arrival in Delhi our suitcase handle was broken." Pros: "Food was tolerable. Good cabin temperature. Good lumbar support and pillow." Cons: "Horrible leg space on the first leg of the journey. Air hostess we'e very inattentive. Asked for a blanket 3 times and still didn't get it. Also they had a poor attitude. Power outlets don't work on multiple seats. Oh and again no leg room. Zilch." Cons: "I will never forget Turkish airlines again. They stole our money. We were at our flight on time but they wouldn't let us board. They then said we were no shows and cancelled all our remaining flights with no refund. This ended up costing us around $3000. We don't have this kind of money and I don't know how we will pay rent next month." Pros: "The little details...slippers, nice meal, foot rests, deep carryon bins." Cons: "Legroom, too tight. Attendants blocking lane unable to reach restroom, entertainment didnt work." Pros: "Lots of entertainment on the plane. Very clean. I like the personal touch of a travel Bag given and large head phones." Pros: "The staff is very accommodating and the meals served on board were good." Cons: "Plane delayed by 3 hours. Missed my other flight to Tirana. Horrible service at the airport to help me out with a hotel. Had to run around for over 3 hours. Never flying Turkish again." Pros: "The service was very nice and courteous" Cons: "The seats don’t match up to the comfort level and privacy of the other airlines" Cons: "Turkish Air lot my suitcase. I will never travel with them again" Pros: "2nd time with Turkish Airlines; no concerns. Everything handled timely and professionally." Pros: "Turkish airlines has great service and crew in plane." Cons: "Hi, The flight was great. However my layover at airport lounge was long. I didn't like their (Turkish Business lounge)policy for not letting me have the room to sleep as the layover was more than 7hrs. I was told to ask for a hotel at reception. When i did, they said that they dont have any hotel inside and cant take me to ourside hotel too. The staff at reception of lounge was not courteous either. I only needed the room to sleep for 3 or 4 hrs.
