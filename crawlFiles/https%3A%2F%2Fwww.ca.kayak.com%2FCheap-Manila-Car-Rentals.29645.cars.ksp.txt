KAYAK’s top tips for renting a car in Manila The main advantage of renting a vehicle during your time in Manila is that it opens the outer areas of the city and nearby countryside for exploration. Fort Santiago, for instance, is just 20 minutes from central Manila by car, but if you were to opt for public transport instead, it could take up to 50 minutes. For travelers planning on renting a vehicle after landing at Manila Ninoy Aquino International Airport, the rental car counters can be found at a variety of locations in the airport. Terminals 1, 2, and 3 all have their own rental car areas located in their respective Arrivals Lobbies. Due to congestion on major roads during the workweek, Manila has enforced the Unified Vehicular Volume Reduction Program (UVVRP), which forbids certain private vehicles from driving on major roads on various days of the week from 7:00 a.m to 8:00 p.m., based on the final digit of their license plate. Specifically, vehicles whose license plates ends with a 1 or 2 are banned on Mondays, 3 or 4 on Tuesdays, 5 or 6 on Wednesdays, 7 or 8 on Thursdays, and 9 or 0 on Fridays. Manila like any major city in the world experiences its fair share of rush hour traffic. Drivers can expect the morning rush hour to pick up around 7:00 a.m. and to last until 9:00 a.m. most mornings, while the afternoon and evening rush hour usually begins at around 4:00 p.m. and finishes up between 6:00 and 7:00 p.m. The key roads to avoid during rush hour in Manila are the R-8 and C-1.

Only use major companies with complete insurance coverage FAQs about renting a car in Manila What type of car is recommended for driving in Manila? It is best to go with a mid-sized to smaller vehicle like a sedan or compact during your time in Manila because of the city’s variable roads. This is because it isn’t uncommon to see small lanes and one-way roads, particularly in the more historic sections of the city. On such streets, larger cars may struggle to fit at times, so to be safe, go with a smaller car. Additionally, parking spaces are often small, especially in densely populated areas. What’s the speed limit in Manila? Streets within Manila feature speed limits from 20 km/h (12 mph) in residential areas to 40 km/h (25 mph) on regular urban roads, while outside of built-up areas the speed limit goes up to 80 km/h (50 mph). On motorways and expressways the speed limit can reach 100 km/h (62 mph). Where are the best places to park in Manila? Private parking garages and lots are convenient great options for drivers who are sticking to the busier parts of town. This is particularly the case in the bay front area, where parking garages are the main option available. In quieter quarters such as residential areas, streetside parking is a more popular and typical option. Drivers should note, though, that many businesses will have private parking lots and garages for their customers to use. How much does it cost to rent a car in Manila?

The staff was excellent - very friendly and helpful, very easy to deal with, and not pushy with extra charges or insurance. Cons:Dropping the car off could have been a little easier - there is no specific car rental return area like there are in many other major airports. So be sure to ask when ask the specifics of where to return the car BEFORE you leave the airport with the vehicle. Otherwise, everything else was great.

And no shuttle to get the rental. 2.0 Poor Jul. 2017 Pros:Nothing Cons:After a 24 hour long flight you simply want your rental car. Well; Avis didn't approve our European driver license! they would only accept US and Filipino driver licenses. There was NOTHING listed about this on the web site. When we deal with them two people was waiting next to us and they told me that they knew it would happen as Avis don't accept foreign driver licenses but they could rent us a car.....well thanks but the car ended up being twice the price. Simply don't rent with Avis in Manila! 6.8 Okay May 2017 Cons:Rental office workers: They should approach people coming in..they just talking to each other and watching customers .they need a lot more of costumer service training. 4.8 Mediocre Apr. 2017 Pros:Staff was very polite Cons:Claimed that location was "in terminal" but had to be shuttled to off airport location. I arrived at avis booth on time as reservation and there was no body at the booth. Waited awhile just to be shuttled to another location. No big deal. At the location it felt like the staff was not ready to hire me a car, told the car was not ready. Took an hour and a half for the car to come. Car came and they told me they are changing my car again due to undisclosed reason. Finally gave me a pretty old toyota vios with lots of scuffs and scratches so that took a long time to mark on the damage report sheet. No big deal. Its just the two lus hours i wasted just to get on the road that ruined the experience.
