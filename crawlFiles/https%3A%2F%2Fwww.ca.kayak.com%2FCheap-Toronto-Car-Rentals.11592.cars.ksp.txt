KAYAK’s top tips for renting a car in Toronto Toronto, Ontario’s capital, is the largest city in Canada. Whether you are visiting this city for business or leisure, it makes perfect sense to rent a car. With Toronto car rental, you can conveniently take a quick day trip to some of the city’s top attractions such as Ontario Science Center, Toronto Zoo and High Park, one of Toronto’s favorite destinations for outdoor lovers. Better still, you can hit the road and enjoy a personalized tour of Niagara Falls. Some of these destinations are never accessible via the city’s public transportation system. Start your Toronto stay by finding cheap car rentals from the several car rental companies domiciled at any of the top four airports in the larger Toronto area (Toronto Pearson International Airport, Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport, John C. Munroe Hamilton International Airport and Buffalo Niagara International Airport). Most Toronto car rental companies provide round-the-clock shuttle bus services from the airport to their locations from where you will pick and drive off in your rented car. Parking in Toronto is more of an art. Even the city’s natives have to do some homework to find the best parking spot and deals in Toronto. For starters, it helps if you are prepared. Be sure to invest considerable time to find the best parking deals. Fortunately, there are apps like Parking.com that you can use to find the best parking deals in the city. It also helps to know that Toronto city bylaws allow for up to 3 hours of free parking in downtown Toronto after 9 pm on weekdays and after 1 pm on Sunday. Looking to rent a car during your time in Toronto? If you are landing at Toronto Pearson International Airport, you will find the rental car desks on Level 1 of both the Terminal 1 and Terminal 3 parking garages. For travelers flying into Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport, the Avis rental car desk is adjacent to the baggage claim area and the Enterprise counter is by the Eireann Quay parking lot. Drivers should keep their eyes open for both streetcars and buses in the downtown area, as both are commonplace. For buses, drivers must be aware that legally you have to yield to buses merging into traffic. As for streetcars, it is illegal to pass a stopped streetcar because you must yield to the passengers disembarking. Toronto, like many other large cities, suffers from daily bouts of rush hour. Typically, drivers can expect rush hour to last from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. and from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. The evening rush hour can be particularly congested for drivers leaving the downtown area, so it is highly advised to time your trip accordingly. Some of the main areas to avoid during rush hour include Highway 401 and Don Valley Parkway. Drivers new to Toronto should be aware that left turns are not allowed at many of the intersections in the downtown area during rush hour. To avoid any complications due to this, even confident drivers should make certain to use a GPS to help them navigate rush hour traffic. 25% of our users found rental cars in Toronto for C$ 34 or less Book your rental car in Toronto at least 1 day before your trip in order to get a below-average price Off-airport rental car locations in Toronto are around 13% more expensive than airport locations on average Intermediate rental cars in Toronto are around 3% cheaper than other car types, on average Toronto car rental experiences: the best tips from KAYAK users Insights shared by verified travelers who rented a car in Toronto Learn how KAYAK collects reviews and tips from users.

FAQs about renting a car in Toronto What type of car is recommended for driving in Toronto? Toronto, like many large cities, has many one-way roads and smaller streets that can be difficult for larger vehicles to navigate. So it is recommended that would-be car renters select a midsize or compact car rather than an SUV. As well, larger vehicles will particularly struggle to find space to park downtown. What’s the speed limit in Toronto? The speed limits in Toronto, and Ontario as a whole, range from 40 km/h (25 mph) in school zones and residential areas to 50 km/h (31 mph) on urban roads, to 80 km/h (50 mph) on rural highways, and up to 100 km/h (62 mph) on expressways and highways. Where are the best places to park in Toronto? Streetside parking can be very difficult to find in the central downtown areas of Toronto, especially when an event, such as a Toronto Raptors game, is going on.

I returned to the rental location an hour / 8kms later and explained why. The associate welcomed me with a smile, spoke with her manager and told me he had waived all charges! Needless to say I was extremely pleased and will be re renting from same location today. Great client service! Cons:Nada 8.0 Very good Apr. 2021 Pros:Staff are friendly and helpful. Cons:To be honest, they could improve their COVID sanitation practises. 10.0 Wonderful Mar. 2021 Pros:Helpful staff, very slow to get car, drop off was fast. Cons:Faster pick up. It really was very slow.

Instructions told me to put the key and rental agreement into an envelop and drop them in the lock-box. There were no envelopes. Now, two days after the return, I have still to receive confirmation that the car was received and the rental completed successfully. Hopefully all went well, but I have no way of knowing. I tried calling Hertz yesterday to find out, but no one answers the phone and one is referred only to the online reservations site. I'd call this "customer no-service". 2.0 Poor Dec. 2021I'm not sure if this is an opportunity for improvement for Hertz, or for Kayak/Priceline, but I was charged more than the advertised price and what was sent to me in my confirmation email I was charged considerably more when picking up the vehicle, 45% more in fact. That was a disappointing surprise. I won't be renting vehicles from Kayak in the future, I'd rather call the rental company directly and find out what the true price is. It's a bit more work, but saving 45% is worth it.

They close without informing you and let you come with a booking to tell you « sorry we cannot give you a car ou manager left » 4. Their employees lie, they told me they couldn’t give me a car because the manager has the key to open the parking door, 10min later I see them opening it. 4. Employee tried to intimidate me by coming closer to me and start to be agressive, which didn’t work of course. To conclude, don’t go there 2.0 Poor Sep. 2022Rude staff, also they charge extra 12$ for parking which doesn't make sense since you are not using their parking, just picking up the car and dropping it off.

When I arrived at that location I was told my reservation was to be picked up at 1245 Danforth Ave. I showed them my reservation confirmation that indicated my reservation was for 330 Front st, but the CS rep at Front st told me there was nothing they could do and there was no car available for me. Danforth location was a half hour away and closed. I spoke with Dollar 800 number and it appeared to me their system is incorrect. The CS rep was trying to explain to me there are 2 “330 front street locations; one in Danforth and one 330 front st West (where I was). I had to explain there are not 2 “330 Front Streets” and the store rep had already told me the address for Dantforth was 1245 Danforth Ave. The phone rep realized this was the issue that somehow these 2 locations are linked as 1 in their system is the best I could tell what was happening. The only thing he could do at this point was offer me a pickup at the airport which was an impossibility for me. To summarize; I made a reservation for 330 Front st, showed up on time to pick it up, had 2 points of confirmation indicating my pick-up was at 330 front st and was told by dollar my reservation was for 1245 Danforth Ave in their system. I have no emails indicating anything about Danforth Ave as a pick-up location. Unable to secure a car from Dollar, I was very fortunate to find and book a last minute rental from another company. Overall an extremely frustrating experience as Dollar could not honor the reservation I made and could not provide me with an explanation as to what occurred to cause the error.

They didn’t accept the booking and so wouldn’t let me rent because I didn’t have a Canadian credit card. Indeed, im not Canadian so why would I have one? Do they not rent to tourists? Non-sense… 2.0 Poor May 2021 Pros:On May 2nd, I filled up the car at 8: 52 am at 537 Keele St west as the car needed to be filled up and I am required to show a receipt that I filled up the car as per the contract agreement. Please see attachment 3 for the receipt and proof of the time of filling up the car. At 9:00 am I returned the car. The same sign was on the door that said that the attendant was away for 15 minutes but unfortunately, I could not wait as I had an urgent appointment and I really need to leave on time. Since there was no one there, I had no choice but to leave the car. There are cameras all over the premise of this AVIS location that can verify I was there on time. I attempted to call the office to let them know I left the car, because I had an urgent very urgent appointment to get to. I finally received a call from AVIS at 9: 13 am, the same salesperson from this AVIS location called me and said that I left the car overnight and that it was damaged. This tells me that he was not there until that specific time or else he would have seen that I just returned the car and I have the receipt of when I filled up the car to prove it. I headed back to the location AVIS 3193 Dundas St W) at 9:19 am to try to figure out what had happened. The attendee insisted I was not there at 9 am. He then proceeded to demand I pay for the scratch on the car. The attendee continued to intimidate me and said that he would call the police, he also said that if I did not sign the documents that he would write down I refused to pay which would cause me even more money. I insisted that he provide me this paper work (which I have) and allow me time to review the paper work before signing anything. It was very hard for me to even ask for time to review the paper work, as he was extremely upset and I was in tears but I knew I had to review anything before signing it, given that he clearly already lied to me as I was clearly there at 9 am having just filled up the car. I have also attached a video of the car showing the front scratch and its significant damage that he said was ok before I even rented the car and also showing the back scratch that he says I caused although it was not there at 9 am when I returned the car. 7.6 Good Jul. 2020 Cons:Given the car model, it was overpriced. 5.2 Fair Nov. 2019 Cons:Drop off at YHM was difficult and there was no signage or information or even a person to direct. 4.0 Mediocre Oct. 2019 Pros:Staff was nice. Cons:The pick up was very difficult. The office was very hard to find. The Shuttle bus never picked us up. We had to take a $15 taxi from the airport. We could have had much better instructions from kayak. 9.6 Wonderful Sep. 2019 Pros:They allowed me to drop off at another location in the city free of charge. This was a real bonus and super convenient.

So I sat there with others for an hour being told "15 minutes till we take you to another location with cars" Turns out the other location is a really poor rental company named Advance Car and Truck Rental (Google 2 star rating with reviews of customers being bullied) that just happens to have the cars we need.. I'm pretty sure they have an agreement going on between the two because its too convenient and this other place wouldn't survive without Discount dumping customers on them. To sum it up, they told me to drop the car off whenever I wanted at Discount and they'd get it in the morning. My contract with them says I have it until 7:25am. They called me 4 times during dinner to threaten me to bring it back to their location by 11pm, or they will keep calling and start charging my credit. So not only did I miss Thanksgiving thanks to all of this, but now I'll have to dispute their "Upcharges" with my credit company. And quite frankly, because of how this was all handled, I'm never going to book with your company again, and I'll never recommend anyone I know book with you either. Sorry to say, but these guys were so rude and threatening on the phone and in person(shoving me out of the way when I dropped off the car) that I'm completely turned off of going through your company. 2.0 Poor Jul. 2018 Cons:I arrived and they offered to rent me the car I had booked for $551 for $2900. This company needs to be sued for fraud and misrepresentation. Their customer service was evil and at the same time they had no office in Toronto. They did not rent me a car in the end because I refused to pay 6x the original price. 2.0 Poor Jun. 2018 Pros:Nothing. Worst. Cons:Landed in Toronto all the way from Edmonton. Went to discount car rental dealership by taxi( they supposed to provide suttle but they don’t) . Found that they canceled reservations without any reason. No notifications nothing( they rent car to different person on higher price). Rent a car for one week. Treat me very bad. No help nothing. Talk rudely (even it’s there fault). Spent 3 hours but no luck and no reason, no response. Need to rent a car from other company as everything was planned for my vacation. Ended with paying $500 instead of $130 for one week car rental plus waste my day for vacation plus all this hassle. 2.0 Poor Jun. 2018 Cons:You canceled my booking. The rental was with Dollar and Europcar as you mentioned. Overall, this cost me over 500 CAD extra. 2.0 Poor Jun. 2018 Pros:Nothing Cons:They didn’t have my car. They said they transferred my order a couple of days I had to pick it up and they said the transfer did not get through. So I had no car. I had to call all the car rentals to find myself another vehicle. I will never rent from them!!

We were stuck paying full price for a service that we didn’t receive. 2.0 Poor Aug. 2023To be honest, I think Kayak needs to do a much better job of vetting the agencies they choose to work with. 1. We arrived at 8:45am, which was 15 minutes early. There was a complete disregard for others people’s time, with a back up of 4 other families, all of which had been waiting. We did not get on the road before 10:45am - 1.5 hours after the appointment time, eating into our ability to start our trip. 2. Green Motion attempted to convince us that we did not have insurance on the vehicle, and tried yo charge us $141.00 for five days worth of additional coverage - I pulled up the Kayak email with the insurance certificate to prove their was existing insurance - the man smiled, giggled as though it was a joke and refunded the cost 3. Kayak states that the rental had unlimited kilometres - Green Motion claimed that they only provide up to 1000km for Ontario residents AND and there are restrictions and fees for crossing both provincial and international borders. Anything over 1000km would afford additional costs 4. Kayak promised a Toyota Yaris or “similar” make and model. We ended up with a small, Mitsubishi with zero trunk space and barley enough room to fit our party size. The car was over 7 years old, had more than 145,000km on it, was over by 1,000km for its oil change, had its tool light on and was in need of servicing, needed its wipers replaced, had zero wiper fluid, and a major crack in the front fender. 5. Green Motion states that the car needed a full tank of gas (not half tank which is the standard) - quite the expectation given the lemon the rented us. 6. Green motion claimed that pine needles on the inside floor interior from camping, that I’m all honesty, required light vacuuming at best, was cause for stating that the car was brought back “excessively dirty”, and charged us an additional $100 as a result. The car had zero stains. Zero damage by us. Was brought back in need of a light vacuuming but we put them more to do their job!!! I watched people getting upset both at pick up and drop off. I was so upset by the end that it did not bother to even challenge them. I just wanted out of there as fast as possible. I think this company is exploitative. I believe it to be misrepresenting itself, is renting vehicles that require significant repair and safety assessments and should not be allowed to continue operations. 10.0 Wonderful Aug. 2023It was so good. 10.0 Wonderful Jul. 2022The staff are very helpful. 8.0 Very good Oct. 2021They were friendly and helpful. It was too bad that I had to take a cab to and from the airport (they are not offering rides due to COVID).

Car outside not clean at all (due to rain...), inside not good too. Not full tanked but we gave back with the same level without any problem. We had to wait 45 min that Payless employee (he was allown in the office) drived us back direction airport. Jacques 2.0 Poor Jun. 2018 Pros:I reserved a pick up time between 11-12pm through kayak. Payless was not located at the airport, yet the address shows up as the airport. They will drop off cars at the airport, but you have to call them first to let them know you arrive. This created 2 challenges for me: 1 - no reception as I don't have a Canadian phone service provider & 2 - Payless was closed at 10 so when I was finally able to call, no one picked up anyways. Unfortunately, even though I clearly stated my needs on the reservation, Payless could not provide what I needed, I was in a foreign country & needed to get to my hotel asap as it was getting late, sooo I rented a car from a competitor (on Memorial Day weekend) and paid about 4 times more. Thanks Payless. Cons:See above. Everything. 2.8 Poor Mar. 2018 Pros:Inexpensive Cons:No signs at the airport. No instructions on how to get to the rental counter. Had to call them to find out.
