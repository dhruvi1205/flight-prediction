L 5.4 Fair lori, May 2018 Pros:Within walking distance of Busch gardens Cons:Needs a serious cleaning and updating N 2.8 Poor Nancy, Mar. 2018 Pros:There was nothing to like about this hotel. Cons:We were met by a group of loud foul-mouthed people at the front door before entering the lobby. Our arrival was very late so much was missed until the following day. The bathroom door was dirty with oily handprints, a hole kicked in at the bottom. Food from a previous guest was in the refrigerator. Stains and cigarette burns in the spread. No blanket. Dirty floors. Cockroaches. Smoke alarm on the desk and battery dying. Overall massively disgusting. Disinterested desk clerk who offered no remedy or assistance. A 4.2 Mediocre Anonymous, Jan. 2018 Pros:Close to Busch Gardens. Water was nice and hot, and shower had good water pressure. Both of the people at the front desk were nice. Cons:Room was outdated and had a lot of damage. My blankets and sheets reeked of cigarette smoke, and my blanket had burn holes and stains on it. People loitering outside, even around 2am.
