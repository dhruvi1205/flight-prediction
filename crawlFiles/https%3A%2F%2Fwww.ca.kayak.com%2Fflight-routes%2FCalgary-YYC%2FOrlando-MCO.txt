Seat assignment is horrible" Cons: "It could have left on time or they could have told us they weren’t leaving and let us get some sleep." Pros: "I loved flying delta comfort. I’m going to do it more often." Cons: "We had to wait at the customs for nearly 1.5hrs, then pick up our luggage, then check in again!!!

Pros: "The people was relaxed and the flight attendant was polite and professional.. everything was on time" Cons: "Nothing at all great service" Pros: "I think they flew so fast. We could land almost on time even though we departed a hour late. Airplane was new and clean." Cons: "Boarding was chaos. They overbooked 25? 45? Anyway, they are in panic. They tried to request ppl to take next day flight by giving away 300 gift card etc. the ppl who were told there are no seats upset and arguing at the gate. Flight was delayed for one hour. Once we are on airplane, they are still shuffling seats around, so ppl cannot move forward. Just standing there for 10mins waiting for things to settle. Flight attendants did not give us a headphone. (I have a headphone for iPhone X so I could not connect it to their entertaiment system.)" Pros: "Everything went as smoothly as possible. Not a hiccup. Great price, great flight, great experience!" Pros: "I enjoyed my flight! Great movies, good food and I was comfortable. Nothing like First Class." Pros: "Excellent crew" Cons: "Entertainment system did not function at all during the flight" Pros: "The boarding was easy, crew was super and the travel was awesome." Seats were comfortable and leg room was good. Slight delay for boarding but nothing too bad. Would fly with them again. Cons: "Everything was great. Westjet is so much better than Air Canada!" Cons: "More than an hour late departing. Added to that it was almost an hour before luggage appeared. Not West Jet’s fault but it made us even later resulting in some of our long drive of our drive to Grand Canyon being in the dark." Cons: "The food could have been better. I don’t mind paying but some nicer, healthier choices would have been nice. It is airplane food so no real surprise. :)" Pros: "Crew were fairly attentive, have experienced better. Liked the Canadian entertainment options, even if very limited." Cons: "Seats were okay, the plane is really showing it's age. Movie selection was very limited, and very dated." Cons: "Minor point. They boarded the plane very early. We got to the gate 1/2 hour before departure, and were almost the last ones to board." Pros: "Dry accommodating staff all around. Thank you" Cons: "More space between people. Not much you can do I understand that. So overall great" Pros: "Crew were very good. The economy seats were "ok".

The Air Canada flight was at 6.30pm ,and the West Jet was suppose to leave at 11.30am" Porter uses the intelligent and logical way of boarding a plane - from the back. Pros: "The crew was very attentive and the seats are comfortable. The waiting time is horrible...they are always late!" Cons: "I like landing at Billy Bishop, it is very convenient and not too crowed but lately the common lounge has gotten so crowed that you can only seat on the floor. The flights are usually 2 hrs delayed sometimes 3 or 4 hrs delayed! so never plan on having a connecting flight on the other side of your tr" Pros: "Bunch of crooks gave me the wrong time. Missed my flight" Cons: "Getting correct to information" Cons: "The 4pm flight not leaving at 10pm. Or at least being informed that the flight was gonna be delayed before 3 pm" Cons: "We could have left on time & we’re Not being informed as to when we’ll be going.

Pros: "Can’t say. Still waiting to get on plane 8:08 pm for an 8:15 pm departure!!!!!!" Pros: "Nothing as we could not take the flight." Cons: "Allowing the option to change your ticket date, but failing all debit and credit cards payments offered, actually means that they are not allowing flight changes due to COVID related issues like they say they do. We had to book new tickets with another airline to get home." Pros: "The crew was great" Cons: "They should be on time but we left 30 minutes later." Pros: "Crew speaking french" Cons: "Check in process is a disaster. The passenger is asked to even weight the luggage to be said by the machine to gonto a counter without good reason: the only thing missing with LATAM is to pilote the plane. Awful." Cons: "Crazy early. Boarding pass says gate closes by 1205 (for scheduled 1220 departure). We TOOK OFF (in air) before 1200. We got yelled at because we arrived only 1 hour early — should be 3 hours early for an “international flight”. Luggage very difficult, Must rush, etc. But everything turned out great. Scl is crazy airport — 20 minute wait for gate ramp when we got there (still 20 minutes early, instead of 40! On a 60-minute scheduled flight!). Huge long walk to immigration. Pretty long wait for bags. But it all worked out fine." Pros: "Not much I can think of" Cons: "Undisclosed charges for bags and a check on that lasted over 30 minutes and my entire family ogn6 people were scattered throughout plane with absolutely no effort to put young kids next to parents" Pros: "Smooth flight, arrived a bit early" Cons: "There was one crew member who was VERY rude to me at the end of the flight" Pros: "SEATs and crew" Cons: "Food was almost nothing, for a 3hr flight plus delay ... not good!" Pros: "Crew was very helpful and polite. Seats are ok" Cons: "Didn’t know that Mac users need to download app before the flight. My suitcase handle was ripped, filed a report. See what happens. I guess someone will contact me." Cons: "Flight attendants rude and lack of cleaning in the toilets." Cons: "One bathroom was out of order, and movie system did not work" Cons: "Plane delayed on tarmac on arrival. Immigration line was chaos with no staff helping to provide order. Missed my connection and changed to another flight the next morning - aeromexico would not pay for hotel or taxi. Supervisors were rude and dismissive, didn’t care about effect on my plans." Pros: "Movies and shows. Blankets. Prompt staff on plane. Snack options." Cons: "Ticket counter was stubborn to release our boarding passes despite having already checked in online. Saying we were “too late”. The kiosk would not release our boarding passes either. Yet, we breezed right through security to the gate and we’re first to board the plane having had to actually wait awhile before boarding. The ticket counter person unnecessarily made us wait even longer when we were already running late due to having spent 11 hours in the hospital day prior from E. coli. The boarding process was also sloppy. Three different attendants asked to see our passports. Why did everyone need to verify us? We were asked very silly and seemingly unnecessary questions before boarding further slowing the process. We were asked before boarding if we had checked a bag, not sure what difference that made." Pros: "Bueno no los culpo parte es del COVID y parte las personas no se prestan mucho a veces ,pero un poco de orientación en algunos caso" Cons: "Mira una observación las personas en silla de ruedas entran primero de acuerdo ,pero a la hora de salir salen caminando y hacen mas lento el proceso de salir,pero bueno" Pros: "The airline manage to put me on an earlier connection to Mexico City, very appreciated" Cons: "Plane seats are very uncomfortable, not enough space" Pros: "Nothing." Cons: "Disaster of a flight - two hours late and blew connections in Mexico City for 11 people in our group." Pros: "The crew was helpful and professional, the food was flavorful and plentiful, the entertainment selection was good and the aircraft was well take care of and had amenities like spots to charge devices" Cons: "The WiFi didn’t work even though it was advertised as working" Pros: "Nothing about boarding" Cons: "After being the only person pulled out of line for my carryon and myself to be checked at the boarding gate, I asked a simple question to the lady who profiled me, “what made you profile me for this additional security check out of hundreds of passengers here, I’d like to know”. I was met with such rude behavior which I never encountered with any airline before. Not only was her attitude rude, she couldn’t answer my question and Aeromexico didn’t bother to get someone fluent in English to answer me. Notice I wasn’t refusing the security check; it’s just that they were rude, cold and made me feel like a criminal while checking me. They need to improve their system for security checks at the boarding gate. I don’t understand why I had to be checked further bc they already check every passenger before entering the gates and boarding area. I still don’t know the answer to my question. The lady’s attitude embarrassed me and ruined my experience. Aeromexico should retrain their staff and make them realize it’s bc of us they have a job and they should be serving us with proper customer service and have their attitudes in check. Because I have every right to ask that question and will continue to do so! I forgot the lady’s name..but would be happy if my msg got taken seriously and the lady made aware.." Cons: "We waiting for 45 minutes on the run way because was not a corridor ready to depart we are number 8 on line. Was not entertainment available the system was down no music, no movies, no nothing" Pros: "Actually, the flat bed seat is not an Aeromexico virtue, this is part of the 787-800 series. Fortunately, All Nippon Airways is serving Mexico City and there is no doubt what is gonna be my next option." Cons: "1. Delayed departure. 2. Mediocre flight attendants with poor understanding of what this kind of long haul flight should be in business class. 3. The two only meals were uneatable. The chicken was carved 2 weeks ago and stored in permafrost before serving. 4. I've flown 7 times the same route with Aeromexico and this was the worst of all of them." Pros: "Nothing im loose my fly . Im sick 10 minutes before boarding. When to the restroom. They don't let me fly. Im explained wat happened. They don't return credits for my next fly .
