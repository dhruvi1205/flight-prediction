Just one comment, the same food option was served on the flights connecting Singapore -Japan & Japan- Singapore after a week. This drawn disappointment to our expectations to the food and ended up eating the same food one week later on the return trip even though it was a different timing. I believe this could be better managed. Thank you.Read more about ANA Thanks ANA team, overall I had a good experience flying with ANA. Just one comment, the same food option was served on the flights connecting Singapore -Japan & Japan- Singapore after a week. This drawn disappointment to our expectations to the food and ended up eating the same food one week later on the return trip even though it was a different timing. I believe this could be better managed. Thank you. Cons: "This is just a poor airline in which I will never fly on again. I will blame it a lot on miscommunication but seats are horrible and need way for cushion especially if you are on a 11 hour flight." Pros: "I loved the film with kabuki characters to introduce safety procedures." Cons: "More seating room, better ventilation." Pros: "Logjam Manila traffic, confusion at MNL, late for check in, but staff got me on the plane. Then my suitcase was busted open at Chicago O'Hare on the conveyor belt and ANA issued me a replacement on the spot. Two problems [ not their fault ] handled beautifully. ANA is truly amazing. Thank You !!" Pros: "Flight departed on time, landed on time....excellent service, too." Cons: "Nothing" Pros: "The stewardesses were kind and courteous, attending to every need with a smile." Cons: "Not vegan/vegetarian options for meals. Also if you are able to upgrade from economy seating, do so! Your legs will thank you for it. L" Pros: "Service Staff Price Professionalism as the ticketing area Great in dealing with children" Cons: "The lounge was somehow poor and noisy because of the airport constructions." Pros: "Pleasant crew, good food. Standard flight as one would expect." Pros: "Crew was very nice and accommodating ... refreshing change." Cons: "Hoping for different movies on the long flight back...and less R rated ones...some different games (like trivia) would have been nice." Pros: "I liked the way the pilot talked to us and let us know what was going on and still got us there on time even though our departure was slightly delayed." Cons: "There had to be something better than pretzels." Ground crew was short and rude. The concourse lack food and shopping, we did not get the seats we requested and to which we were assigned. The flight crew was pleasant and helpful. Although we are members of the star alliance.. the woman at the desk wouldn’t admit us into the lounge. We also pay for entry into the lounge. It was a very disappointing trip. I’ll probably look into another airline next time I travel, Flight never showed up and there was no one at the airport to help . My flight was cancelled and Air cañada said they didn’t even have that flight number or my name in their computer. Does this mean Kayak somehow messed up with the letters/ number sequence? No one would help me at the airport. Lufthansa said it was Air cañadas fault and I had gotten two messages from Kayak, one was at 6 am(I had already called a ride so I was going an hour earlier ) then after 2 hours at airport I get my message from Kayak(Ricky) saying sorry your flight is cancelled? Then, like I say, no one would even put me on standby for another flight as my numbers you gave me did not match. Can you please get me on a flight home? No later than Monday, please? I am out of money Pros: "Lufthansa is an airline that prides itself on timeliness and service. The boarding procedure was very good, food was very good and service was excellent. I have flown with Lufthansa before and they always prove to me that I’ve made the right choice booking with them!" Cons: "The weather, we hit some turbulence which is beyond the Captains control. Seatbelt sign came right on and even with that we still landed about 20 minutes early in Frankfurt" Pros: "Crew was helpful and ver polite and efficient" Cons: "At the boarding gate they were cherry picking whose bag is too large and whose isn't. My bag was tagged for nothing, no one at the aircraft was to load them to baggage hold. Plenty of space on the plane. What is the point of the fuss." Pros: "Good service, brand new aircrafts, very helpful ticket agent. Yes" Cons: "Delayed departures, both in Zchicago and Munich." Cons: "My bag was lost, exsept close I lost life-saving drags like insulin and other. I not live in Finland and don’t have there my medical record that can go in farmasy without medical prescription to buy medicin. Today is my 70 years burthday. This is a good present to celebrate. Thank you" Pros: "Premium economy seats make a huge difference in terms of comfort. The Vegan pre-selected meal was way better this leg of the trip than the LAX to FRA trip. Entertainment was good too." Cons: "No seat assigned at check-in or even as they begin boarding. I thought I was flying Lufthansa. Air Canada gate agents were condescending. Very disappointed." Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "I have been transatlantic for forty years on various carriers. Without a doubt this was my worst flying experience ever." Long delay die to pet mix up. Also bags took forever to get to carousel Pros: "Crew did the best they could under the conditions" Cons: "There was a broken toilet that was very loud and created long line ups because economy only had use of the 1 bathroom while the first class had 2 bathrooms for so few people" Pros: "Crew and staff at gate fantastic. Accommodated me sitting with partner on both legs (booked flights separately)." Cons: "Flight was delayed. Always tough late at night." Pros: "flight was fine and on time, this leg of my trip was easy" Pros: "All westjet workers are amazing. Starting from the people at the front desk, the crews on the plan and the people that give direction." Pros: "Good crew and on time departure" Cons: "Overnight flight. How nice it would have been to have blanket and pillows as provided by some airlines ." Pros: "The attendant didn’t take any chance on rainy whether condition and got me on an earlyer flight to make sure I wasn’t goinig to miss my connections flights. It worked out perfectly." Cons: "Everything was perfect. Thank you" Cons: "Delays left us in the plane for almost 1 1/2 hours before leaving Toronto." Pros: "Good price for long haul destination. Efficient check-in and boarding process. Decent leg room for a budget airline." Cons: "Food choice a bit limited - especially the free offering. In-flight entertainment is only available from the WestJet app to view on your own device - you need to know this before you board - otherwise you are not able to access any of the movies etc." Pros: "Joesph air host was amazing! Took care of numerous people with kindness & professionalism on our morning fright from Toronto to Vegas!" Cons: "Lots of kids on the flight. Parents did a great job coupled with the staff. I very grateful! I needed a nap ! Iol" Unfriendly staff, delayed flight, luggage took almost an hour. Very disappointing. One United employee a little impatient, also on flight WiFi was out for some time. I was happy to receive a complimentary alcoholic beverage for volunteering to check my carry on bag. I enjoyed everything generally. However, getting from the Tarmac to the arrival building required we got on a Bus and meaning they had to wait on everyone to get in from the plane eating a significant amount of time and we still had to get o. The air shuttle to get to the arrival building and saw passengers with connections having to run all the way. My experience flying from Ottawa to Montreal was not good! A long international flight and not even a snack? Really? One drink in five hours? Really? Worse service, they canceled the flight 3 hours before departure and only informed us by text More stress and uncertainty. My flight from Ottawa to Toronto was delayed due to a tech issue and I would have missed my connection to Nashville. I tried calling AC customer service and after a 1+hr hold, was told there were no earlier flights to Toronto (not true)and if she booked me on another flight, I'd have to spend the night in Toronto. Fortunately at AC check-in, I was able to get on the earlier flight (last seat due to a cancelation) and was able to make my connection. In the end, I got into Nashville an hour late, due to delays on the Toronto/Nashville connection. Both going to Ottawa and returning, I was faced with delayed flights and missed connections. I just want the confidence that flights are going to arrive and leave on time. When a person pays 500 $ for one way ticket that person should have better seat not the seat before the bathrooms.🤔🤨 Seating is very tight. We were delayed 90 minutes to board, because the flight crew were late Pros: "Amazing crew and Ground staff. Check in and bag check in was really smooth and fast." Cons: "Maybe some more options of snacks. In flight entertainment was not working so can’t say much about it." Was my best trip. Everything was on time and it all went so smoothly.. Pros: "There were delays beyond the pilot or crews control and they handled the situation in a very courteous and respectful way, much appreciated." Pros: "..." Cons: "I got stuck in the airport through the whole night" Pros: "Comfortable seats, no delays, smooth flight" Cons: "Food choices were terrible - breakfast time and no breakfast food, no sandwiches just overpriced snacks." Pros: "The counter staff employee was kind enough to find seats next to one another for my partner and I." Cons: "More snack options." Pros: "The view." Cons: "Landed early by a bit. Made to wait on runway 30 minutes before we could park at gate. Figure it out United - maybe if you worked with your airport partners better they’d help you the 1 or 2 times you’re actually early." Pros: "The crew was friendly and helpful." Cons: "Better snacks would be nice, and there was no entertainment available, even for personal devices." Pros: "Steward and Stewardess very nice and helpful" Cons: "Walk between flights was extreme - tracked at about a mile! The video movie was incredibly choppy making entertainment frustrating." Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "No assistance at all for handicap person, try to ask for help and was told grab a wheelchair and have your family push you or wait till 530 which my flight would be boardiat that time." Pros: "plane is new/crew was friendly" Cons: "no legroom/food was horrible; worst ever on any flight I have taken to and from korea.
