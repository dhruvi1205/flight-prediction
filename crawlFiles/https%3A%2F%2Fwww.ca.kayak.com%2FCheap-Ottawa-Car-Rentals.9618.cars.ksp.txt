KAYAK’s top tips for renting a car in Ottawa Drivers planning to move around the city with cheap car rentals in Ottawa should be aware of the toll roads. Ottawa has one major toll road, 407 ETR, that you should know before hitting the road for an adventure. This road has to be paid for before being used for adventure. Therefore, most car rental companies in Ottawa do not cater to the road charges; instead, they ask the drivers to pay using their own money. The payment can only be done through the toll booth before getting on the road. You can pay using the Fastrac method, by check, cash, online banking, or pay-by-plate. When driving your cheap car rentals in Ottawa, think about keeping the back seat for your kids for it is a safe place for them to be in a moving vehicle. The limitations on kid safety seats should be understood by parents who rent cars in Ottawa. When driving around the city, children between the ages of 4 and 5 must be buckled into one of these seats. So, make sure to ask for and receive the child seat when making a car reservation with your preferred car agency. All Ottawa car rentals provide child-safety seats. While using these seats, you will need to pay a daily fee. Use cheap car rentals in Ottawa to connect to different locations in the city with more flexibility. Renters must be 21 years of age or older to use any of the Ottawa car rentals. However, in some car rental agencies, you should be 25 years or older to rent a luxury vehicle. You must have two documents with you while picking up your car. One of the fundamental documents required is a driver's license that is valid for the full rental duration. A credit card or debit card bearing your name is the second required documentation that would facilitate the payment process. Canada’s capital is an evergreen city that is overflowing with spectacular parks and gardens. Ottawa is located along the Ottawa River and is connected to the Rideau Canal, providing extensive opportunities to get outside and enjoy the wonders of nature. Renting a car will give you unrivaled access to the glorious hiking trails of Gatineau Park while also allowing the time to take in the significant cultural arts attractions, such as the National Gallery and Canadian Museum of History. If you are planning to attend an Ottawa Senators ice hockey match, renting a car is the best option since Canadian Tire Center is more than 25 km (15 miles) from the downtown district. Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport (YOW) is located approximately 11 km (7 miles) from downtown and you will be able to arrive in just over 20 minutes of driving. Rental companies Alamo, Avis, Budget, Hertz, and Enterprise have their counters located on Level 1 of the parking facility, directly across from the baggage claim area. Since the expanse of parklands and outdoor activities lends Ottawa to be an optimal location for bike riding, so be vigilant while driving and remember to check blind spots regularly. Turning right at a red light is legal in Ottawa unless otherwise indicated by signage; however, always remember to stop at the intersection and ensure the road is clear. Ottawa and the surrounding areas of Ontario are well known for the heavy amounts of snowfall they often get during the winter. If you are planning to travel during this time of the year you will witness some beautiful frozen lakes and scenery; however, be extra cautious while driving. It is important to regularly check weather reports which will provide information on road conditions and safety. When driving on icy roads, remember to reduce speeds and allow more braking time and space than you would in normal conditions. 25% of our users found rental cars in Ottawa for C$ 47 or less Book your rental car in Ottawa at least 1 day before your trip in order to get a below-average price Off-airport rental car locations in Ottawa are around 41% more expensive than airport locations on average Intermediate rental cars in Ottawa are around 6% cheaper than other car types, on average Ottawa car rental experiences: the best tips from KAYAK users Insights shared by verified travelers who rented a car in Ottawa Learn how KAYAK collects reviews and tips from users.

Vehicle had so many KM and was starting to fall apart. Vehicle was dirty even though they said it was clean. Back seatbelt didn’t work. Weird brake noises. Was charged $750 credit card hold. 2.0 Poor Oct. 2022Car was dirty , hadn’t been disinfected , vacuumed, customer service was ok , felt rushed .. not a personal experience. Most rental places drive you back , but they did not. Price was reasonable, got in on a good price. Don’t think I would go back to that particular location. Maybe try another location next time! 2.0 Poor Oct. 2022I was unable to rent a vehicle, though I had reserved one. The machine to read my licence did not work, so I could not proceed with renting the vehicle that I had reserved. The staff seemed to imply that my licence was invalid. They said to me that I should try to rent from another company, which I did. There was no problem with my licence being read and another company was happy to rent to me, though I missed out on the better priced vehicle from Budget. 2.0 Poor Oct. 2022I have been overcharged and will now have to contact Budget to resolve the $500 on my card. Upon pick up, the vehicle was disgustingly dirty. There was a chip in the windshield and during the walk around, the employee said that if it worsened it would be at my cost. He did not even inspect the inside of the vehicle. They were not even open upon me returning the vehicle. They did not honour my promo code.

Thankfully, Avis found an intermediate car for me at a nearby location for no extra charge, which I appreciated. Seems like a miscommunication between the Kayak and Avis systems. 6.8 Okay Aug. 2020 Cons:We received quite a larger vehicle than booked as the type of vehicle we had booked was not available so I think the vehicle should have been the correct size. Also, the vehicle had Florida license plates and being in Canada and driving, because of the travel restrictions and people’s heightened stress, we didn’t feel comfortable driving in Canada with the Florida plates under Covid. 10.0 Wonderful Apr. 2019 Pros:After streetparking my mirror had been flopped back. Sure enough-two dents in the door - I had been side swiped. I reported to insurance and Avis Ottawa who were very calm and supportive. Returning the car, an employee immediately told me that it was old damage. Honest and clear service. 2.0 Poor Feb. 2019 Cons:The rental place was supposed to open at 8 A.M. (as was indicated on their own front door), which was when my pickup was arranged for. I got there at 8:05 A.M. and waited until 8:25 A.M. until I had to find other arrangements to get to my appointment because no one showed up. 4.0 Mediocre Sep. 2023I booked a dodge challenger but given a ford escape. The ford interior had not been vacuumed and had dirt and food debris in the console/gear shift. The exterior of the vehicle had not been washed and the windshield was covered with dead bugs.

I found papertowel (used) in the car. Not acceptable at all given this is a Covid pandemic. I was told after I had booked the car that Costco members get a discount. The agents never really tell you about any features or benefits. When I showed up the woman was not there so I had to wait for her. 4.4 Mediocre Sep. 2020 Pros:Nothing but the initial price of the car itself. Cons:Customer service, after hour return policy, initial and final inspection accuracy, insurance plans, ease of finding the rental place, and so many more. 2.0 Poor Aug. 2020 Pros:The company cancelled on me! 5.6 Fair Jul. 2020 Pros:The staff was okay. I was told the car was a new model but when I got in the car it smelled like marijuana. The AC was on and this is what it smelled like. 4.0 Mediocre Jul. 2020 Pros:I had asked for an economy car but I was told that none were available despite the fact that I had booked economy. Cons:They should go outside with the customer to do an inspection of the car and to explain the features of the car. 6.0 Okay Oct. 2019 Cons:When someone rents a GPS it should have instructions with it or the operation be explained. I could not get sound out of it and old address kept coming up. It was night time rain and it seems all the City is in Construction, and the GPS does not work very dangerous.

They keep charging me for unreasonable amount for no reasons and even when I gave back the car they kept charging me. That have my card number informations but they do t have the right to take money on my cards. My location was supposed to cost me 90$ and it end up costing me 230$. Absolutely unacceptable 2.0 Poor Nov. 2023I booked a moving truck/van online with UNLIMITED km's on the vehicle (it said so on the website as well as my conformation email) just to be told no we are going to charge to 30 cents per km. I told the lady there no I have proof that it says unlimited and I showed her as well as the other employees then she said no its in the terms of service.....So she tried to find it and it wasn't there. I read the ENTIRE thing and its not there. I asked her what is the excuse now because she was wrong and I could tell the whole time she knew she was wrong, then she said ok I will give it to you for 15 cents per km....along with the $1500 deposit for a truck stay away from this place!! They will try to scam you with their BS km and just booking the vehicle is non-refundable so they get you to book just to be told when you get there that you cant have it for what was advertised. 2.0 Poor Oct. 2023Ri 2.0 Poor Oct. 2023They ddid not have the car that I reserved 2.0 Poor Oct. 2023The contract said unlimited milage but Routes would not honor it. The Route staff was very rude and refused to give his name so that I could launch a formal complaint. In the end, I ended up not renting from them. I was stranded as I had recieved a ride to pick up the van from Routes location. It was terrible experience. I will never rent with Routes again even if it was free. Regards, Nazib 4.0 Mediocre Mar. 2023Few points to mention: - Reservation clearly stated and I had the printed "terms and conditions" where it says "Unlimited Mileage" - but when we came to pick-up, we were told that only 200 km a day are included!!! We needed to make a trip involving abut 1000km and accounted for that when booked. - Then we were told that we need to put down a deposit of $1500!, while we have insurance provided by our credit card - The car at pick-up although ok on the outside, inside was dirty - Also, we booked a Nissan Rogue and got a Ford Escape, which was not our first choice... I most likely, will never rent a car from this company. Very misleading information.
