KAYAK’s top tips for renting a car in Edmonton While the capital of Canada's Alberta region may offer good transportation services in the city, renting a car is a great option for travelers looking to embark on some outdoor adventures outside the city. Driving is the best way to get to must-see destinations that are fairly close to the city such as the Elk Island National Park, which is only a 35-minute drive from Edmonton and is the perfect place to hike, canoe, or even camp. Head to the Beaver Hills Dark Sky Preserve, which is located just 40 minutes east of Edmonton, for an incredible stargazing experience and a good chance to spot the northern lights. All the big car rental agencies can be found at Edmonton International Airport (YEG), including Alamo, Enterprise, and Hertz. The car rental counters are located near the baggage claim area on Level P1 (Ground Level) of the Parkade. Some car rental companies may require that you contact them a few days in advance, so make sure you chose one that accommodates your needs. Edmonton has a few interior highways and even a ring road, but you don't necessarily have to take the main roads (such as Whitemud, Yellowhead, or Anthony Henday) as they end up being the busiest. Look out for cyclists during the months when the weather is good. The weather can be quite harsh in the winter, so reduce your speed and keep a safe distance between your car and the other vehicles since roads can get slippery. Although traffic in Edmonton is fairly manageable when compared to other Canadian cities, rush hour can still add an extra 30 minutes to an hour to your travel time. Take this into consideration when driving into or out of the city's downtown core, and avoid morning rush hour (between 7:30 a.m. and 9 a.m.) as well as afternoon rush hour (between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m.). The Anthony Henday freeway is one of the busiest roads in Edmonton during rush hour, as well as the Whitemud freeway, which is usually busy with traffic heading from south to north and vice-versa. 25% of our users found rental cars in Edmonton for C$ 47 or less Book your rental car in Edmonton at least 1 day before your trip in order to get a below-average price Off-airport rental car locations in Edmonton are around 12% cheaper than airport locations on average Intermediate rental cars in Edmonton are around 26% cheaper than other car types, on average Edmonton car rental experiences: the best tips from KAYAK users Insights shared by verified travelers who rented a car in Edmonton Learn how KAYAK collects reviews and tips from users.

The one staff member that was working was having a bad night.. he was very cold and rude so I asked empathetically how his night was going. He responded it wasn't going well. Next, I had requested a compact and recieved a mini van. Altho thos is a nice upgrade, it's not what I asked for. I asked the clerk if he was coming out to inspect the car with me but he said he wasn't able as he had two more people waiting behind me. He said if I could see any dents, to come in and tell him. He said superficial scratches don't matter. I proceeded to the vehicle and noticed some scratches but was told not to worry about this. It was 10:00pm so was dark and dimly lit. I looked as best as I could. I should also mention, I'm 5'2" so could not see the top of the vehicle. I drove this vehicle minimally, to my dad's and back to the airport over the 3.5 days I used it. The gas fill was only $7.50 before returning it. I returned it and the lady who greeted me was very kind. I left the parking lot and went through security to my flight and was called by a Hertz staff member that there was a scratch on the bumper and a dent on the roof. I absolutely did not make these marks for certain and should have had a staff member look it over before driving away as I am too short to have seen this prior to leaving with this huge vehicle and was told not to worry about scratches. I verbally asked them to send me untouched photos, to leave the dust on the vehicle as not to touch where these so called dent and scratch were...untouched as it may prove this was there prior to me renting it if all the dust on the car was uniform. This staff member told me they would do so asap. I also emailed them with this same request. I never did recieve these photos. I was treated like a criminal as this staff member was hostile and rude telling me this was my fault. I'm not an auto specialist...this is not my area of expertise. I asked the original rude staff member to inspect with me and he refused. If these marks were indeed on this van, then this was done prior to me using this vehicle and should have been inspected by upon the return from the previous renter. I shouldn't be paying for someone else's oversight. 10.0 Wonderful Nov. 2022The staff was very friendly and did not shy away from any questions I asked in detail. I was fortunate for them to track down a Car with winter tires which made my Trip to Banff all the more enjoyable. I had no issues with pickup and drop off. I could not ask for anything more! 10.0 Wonderful Oct. 2022Customer Service was Excellent and Very Friendly Staff.

I ended up cancelling my reservation Cons:Let people know online when making a reservation. That you need a MasterCard. And that you don’t accept visa. Kind of shitty. Making a reservation online put all my info in. All my card info. Just to show up. And not even be able to get it cause they can’t swipe my Visa card.

No signs where to take car. Finally found a tiny sign to drive to the 7th fl of garage. No attendant around.

Teasonable Cons:Downtown drop off location was impossible due to lack of deatails, signage, traffic no where to stop. Deatailed directions for complicated drop off downtown should be provided. Alternative location should be provided with directions 10.0 Wonderful Jun. 2018 Pros:The attendant at the drop off location was helpful and attentive to my concern and fixed the problem. Cons:AVIS was charging me for a late fee, when I had paid for 2days (2*24hr periods) 2.0 Poor Dec. 2017 Cons:Booked a Tahoe online and when we went to pick up the car and was signing all the documents, noticed the price was more than 4 times the price. I showed them my confirmation but the time my just told me there must have been an issue with the booking site. There was no mention of this before I was about to sign and they would not honor the confirmed price I had so I left and went to Alamo who gave me a great deal. Thank you Alamo.
