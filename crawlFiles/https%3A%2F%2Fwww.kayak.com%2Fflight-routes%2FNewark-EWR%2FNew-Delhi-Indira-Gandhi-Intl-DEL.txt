They often do.Read more about Japan Airlines I hope they never ran out of the menu choice one makes. They often do. Pros: "Just excellent. Excellent crew, excellent food, excellent aircraft, and excellent leg room. No recommendations." Pros: "JAL lounge at Haneda was the best I've ever been in. The Business Class configuration is terrific -- as private as can be on an airplane, without going First. And the JAL staff, on the ground as well as in the air, are Grade A diplomats, counselors, and -- in a word -- professionals. Which is sorely lacking in US air carriers, who don't seem to understand that air travel is a service industry, and to excel in a service industry, PEOPLE are most important to the customers. Specifically, having enough people: US airline employees are well-trained professionals too, but "corporate" consistently under-hires/deploys, which leaves employees juggling far too much at once, which degrades the service experience for the customer. Yeah, I get "the bottom line," but service industry customers will always go to businesses that offer better service. Ok, rant over. JAL is tops." Cons: "Security and Immigration at Tokyo Haneda is harder than at US airports, but that's to be expected and nothing that JAL can control." Cons: "Very good airline except for the fact that the staff at Narita airport." Cons: "I feel like this is Japan Airlines’s chance to present some great actual Japanese food in flight and instead it was a tuna melt and macaroni salad. Just saying." Pros: "The crew" Cons: "The foods could be better not up to the standard of EVA air on economy class" Pros: "Leg room at seats were spacious, comfy. However , toilets could be cleaner." Cons: "This is 2 nd time I flew JAL. And food was below average. Should offer cup noodles or biscuits if pax is hungry ." Pros: "Cabin crew were very nice. Food was okay, while the legroom was good too." Cons: "Delayed flight, but the email notification from JL was lacking the most important detail... The new take off time! It was 70 minutes later than advertised, but then delayed by another five minutes on top after a late take off." Cons: "The fact that my father was diagnosed with Cancer and they wouldn’t refund our 1300.00 for round trip tickets to the Philippines which is our vacation home. The airline required documentation from my fathers doc which I provided. He was not going anywhere for at least a year (radiation and chemo) and the denied even credit.I was able to get my parents tickets refunded by a different airline. NEVER Again. my father passed 8/12/2018. Our trip was scheduled for 9/13/2018. Very disappointing.see" Pros: "The staff are always very polite and professional. Food was fine (better the past years). Everything was punctual and orderly." Cons: "The seats were extremely uncomfortable. The gray ones were much better (San Diego to Narita) in comparison." Pros: "Food is amazing, planes are good." Cons: "The boarding crew at the gate did not say anything while weighing the carry on bag. I was ask to go to another person who issued me check in baggage sticker and told me to hand over your baggage to a person inside. At last he mentioned to not put any valuables in that bag. My carry on bag was just 1lb extra and the first person could have told me right away and I would have thrown away chocolates and brought down the weight to permissible limit. In general passenger do carry valuable stuff in carry on bag. I had to follow whatever I was told." Pros: "Plane was modern and more comfortable than most" Cons: "I do understand that it was an overnight flight but the crew came around only during meals and at no other time did they check on us. I hit the call button and nobody came - call button just went off. I was in the middle next to a sleeping passenger and could not get up." Pros: "The crew was great and the dinner was really good!" Cons: "Breakfast could have been better and the seat was pretty uncomfortable" Pros: "The crew was fantastic. The food was good for airline food." Cons: "The seats were narrow and seemed a bit smaller than usual." Pros: "For an economy seat, was very comfortable!! Love the food." Pros: "Overall a decent flight." Cons: "Didn’t like the boarding experience. You have somebody look at the boarding pass but then they sent us to a waiting area. The waiting/boarding area didn’t have space to make nice lines fir boarding so it was pretty haphazardly organized. You really can do better." Pros: "They were very courteous and provided us with a solution with an overweight luggage so that we wouldn’t pay the extra fees. Flight was very smooth on the 777. Best flight ever." Cons: "Nothing negative about this flight." Pros: "Cleaningness" Cons: "Main problems at Dubai airport. Employee at the airport charged me money for the same luggage that Newark employees said it is according to air line rules. That shocked me. I didn’t buy anything from Dubai. I think it’s not right." Pros: "Neat and clean. People at Newark airport" Cons: "Service of air host. Attitude of people at Dubai airport" Pros: "Crew was fantastic!! Definitely will travel with Emirates again!!" Cons: "Seats a bit uncomfortable but I know nothing can be done about that, so everything else was great." My Tv don’t work the whole from Doha to New Delhi. Overnight didn’t work from Bos to Doha and had to eat food without light Good and comfortable flight Helpful crew Decent food and drinks Was humiliated at Doha airport, treaded like a cattle class traveler, I hold platinum pro status with AA and I don’t fly economy even domestic but was made to travel in the middle seat in economy class and boarding zone 3 and was denied lounge access at Doha airport. Never was humiliated like this before. Pros: "Great crew, great customer service by phone, great food and entertainment." Cons: "Boarding and deplaning took ages, but don't they always?" Pros: "Crew was nice" Cons: "Bassinet seats could be bigger for comfort with an infant." Cons: "Crew needs more booster, perhaps? so they can share some smiles and warm gestures like what we experienced during flight from Singapore to Doha. Ability to choose kids' meal 24 hours before flight. we don't know the avail menu, hence we ordered on outbound only, unable to change afterwards." Pros: "Crew was superbly amazing which made flight enjoyable." Cons: "Heating food with plastic containers is unhealthy and might cause cancer to people. It’s scientifically proven fact that plastic and heated food is carcinogenic. So please find other solution for it. Thanks" Pros: "The crew was very cheerful and helpful even though I was puking my guts out on a long flight with a lot of turbulence" Cons: "It was an insanely long and pukey flight. The airsick bags have this seal that you have to tear off before you can open it which my son discovered a little too late." Pros: "The crew was FANTASTIC!! SO kind and helpful, and went out of their way the whole flight to assist us with anything and everything we needed! :)" Cons: "There was a person name Manzoor at Lahore airport working with Qatar Airways ticketing he was asking me to pay him $50 to help me get boarding pass. i will also contact Qatar Airways about this incident if this issue is not going to forward to the airline please let me know." Pros: "Amazing - they had a full dinner for a 9:55pm flight, with real silverware, complementary alcohol, for economy passengers! Crew extremely professional and efficient." Pros: "Food was ok" Cons: "AC was not turned on until flight was up in air. That means for 30 minutes passengers were sweating sitting in a suffocating cabin. Crew refused to give Green Tea, saying only available in business class Inflight screen size was very small ...5-6 inches only" Pros: "Crew was very nice and attentive" Cons: "Leg room on my first flight (longest leg of the trip) was not much and when the person in front of me leaned their chair back, my knees were touching the chair." Pros: "The crew was great! The entertainment was pretty good too." Cons: "The cabin was WAY too warm." Pros: "Food was good. Crew was kind and gracious." Cons: "Seats were extremely cramped. Once the person in the front reclined their seat it was very difficult to get out of the seat. Also better guidance is needed during boarding. Finally, my hand carry was checked 4 times by 4 different people, which means your staff doesn’t trust their own colleagues." Pros: "Everyone was friendly, pleasant and very helpful. Upon arrival in Delhi our suitcase handle was broken." Cons: "Despite listing items desired for breakfast per seat assignment, flight attendant still got it wrong." Pros: "A very friendly and attentive crew and a decent meal. Comfort is still iffy in coach but better than most American airlines. Good selection of movies to pass the time." Cons: "Seats in coach are cramped and some have an electrical box under the seat in front of you, so there is no room for your legs or carry on bag. Bathrooms keep getting smaller to jam in more seats." Pros: "The movies were good, the food was good. Servers were kind and helpful. Clean and overall positive flight." Cons: "Several delays and gate changes." Cons: "The way the movies, needed extra parts. No touch screen" The Virgin seats in business are quite narrow and also don’t recline enough in a seated position. When you make them into a bed, it is quite hard, despite the thin cover and cannot be adjusted at all, in comparison to business seats in other airlines. Virgin need to upgrade the quality of their seats. The food on this flight, I had an AVML was not good, normally though I have found the food to be good. Other than that, the staff were very attentive and pleasant during this long 14 hour flight. Pros: "People were friendly. Flight was comfortable." Cons: "Staff incorrectly assessed documents needed for visas, and told us we were incomplete and needed to return home. Instead of looking up policy, we were denied boarding mid-flight, missed a wedding, and had to spend three days in London instead of our destination. Also, we got bug bites during the flight that turned out to be from bed bugs, which followed us home and caused much frustration for months." Pros: "I travelled on economy delight, flight was fully packed, yet it felt spacious and comfortable. Lightning was great. Food was yummy! And pilots gave us updates on air travel, and if there were any delays etc." Cons: "Nothing. Had a great trip!" Pros: "The crew was so kind and amazing. They definitely made our flight great!" Cons: "The entertainment wasn’t working for most of the flight. We only got about an hour and a half of entertainment" Cons: "Information on when we can check in on upcoming flights. Other airlines we have booked for flights will email us 24 hours prior to departure. Virgin Atlantic did not. I had to call and I was directed to their web site and was able to check in on line. Thanks" Pros: "Great crew, good in-flight movies. Good food." Cons: "Wifi connectivity was poor for most of the flight. Plane was very hot it was difficult to sleep." Cons: "We are a little hard of hearing. It was hard to hear the attendant when giving directions over the intercom. The speech was garbled and directions spoken too fast. I am not referring to the safety speech. Recommend slowing down so that we have more time to process what was spoken." Pros: "The seats reclined at a good pitch and were very comfortable. The crew were friendly and service was good." Cons: "I understand that on the night flight, they were trying to keep the lights up for dinner service, but it prevented my toddler from being able to sleep and thus made for a difficult rest of the journey." Cons: "I cancelled this flight online, then I called to let them know I was getting emails, but that I had cancelled. For two days I received emails about delayed flights and now this." Pros: "My flight was canceled and Virgin Atlantic gave us a free room in the hotel Ramada. My next flight was at 18:55 and I asked Virgin Atlantic agent am I allowed to stay in the room until time for my flight comes, he confirmed yes and gave me breakfast, lunch, and dinner voucher. However, next day around 12 I got call from Front Desk that I have to leave my room right away because it's time to chack out and If I want to stay longer I have to pay. I called Virgin Atlantic agancy again and the agent run my information and said to me I can stayin the room longer. After that I called front desk to confirm that but they said they didn't hear anything from Virgin Atlantic and I have to leave the room by 1pm. All of this was really unpleasant!"
