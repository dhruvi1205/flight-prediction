However, once in the air, the crew gave its usual excellent service.Read more about Korean Air After the gauntlet of unnecessary security, and the two mile jog to make the flight, the flight was delayed 20 minutes on the ground for takeoff.. However, once in the air, the crew gave its usual excellent service. 2 hour connection time in Seoul to make plane to Bangkok. Giant security lineup. Lots of worry over making flight reduced joy of flying via KE/Incheon. This was a repeat of my flight in Nov 2022, so apparently is the new normal for KE. Flight was boarding after I was forced to jog what seemed to be 2 miles from security to my departure gate. Please fix this. I still cannot understand that if you have already been screened in Canada for dangerous items, and there is no opportunity to obtain any between one plane and the next, why you should be screened AGAIN. Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "The seat, the food, the services, the boarding could have been better!" Pros: "Well organized loading, courteous staff, great vegetarian food provided, liked the real metal silverware and glass wine glass on the SEA>ICN route." Cons: "My usb charger connection was too loose to charge" Pros: "There were movies." Cons: "too late giving out ear phones, and too many interruptions on the loud speaker....way too long explaining things everyone knows, like how to buckle your seat belt....give me a break." Cons: "Seats weren’t as comfy or spacious as I would have thought given Korean air Having won best economy liner a few times. No entertainment in seats either." Pros: "Great crew, good food, easy to watch entertainment , and food better than most airlines" Pros: "That the bathrooms are kept clean." Cons: "Lack of beverage service. For an 11.5 hour flight they could have come around more often to offer pop or alcoholic beverages." Pros: "Flight attendants were the friendliest and most patient I have ever experienced. Great customer service!!!" Cons: "Seats of any airplane could use improvement on comfort. But comfort was good." Pros: "We liked the boarding in Atlanta and in Seoul with the people boarding by the numbers of their rows - boarded the back rows, then the middle then the front. Worked so much better than everyone rushing to get on! Flight attendants were very helpful with everything and always kind. Loved being able to sit in the exit row seats!!" Cons: "Food was okay - we fly Korean Air whenever we travel to SE Asia and it seems the food is the same no matter what flight we are on. We like the pizza snack better than the bun with meat inside they served us on this trip." Pros: "New plane or so it seemed. Crew very attentive to needs. Nice entertainment system with large screen." Pros: "Crews were friendly and helpful. I never had economy seat that goes as flat as theirs. I liked the safety instruction video." Cons: "They seemed to run out of food options quickly. Wasn't a problem for me. But, they should know better." Pros: "Crew was amazing, food was filling & plentiful." Cons: "Overall no complaints but the landing in Tokyo was a little rough. Pilot seemed to descend quickly which hurt my ears but otherwise, smooth flight." Pros: "The crew is amazing but that is to expect since it was a Japanese crew that operated from Narita." Cons: "The vegetarian food was terrible; unless they mistook my request and did a vegan option. The first meal was an o-k noodle stirfry type of thing but the breakfast was a porridge that had no flavor. Hopefully it was a misunderstanding but worth noting." Pros: "Staff were friendly. Alcohol beverages are free. Good upsated movie selections." Pros: "The cabin crews were excellent. Food was delicious. Lots of leg room in Economy class. Overall had a great experience" Cons: "none" Pros: "The crew was amazing! The food was really great! And the entertainment was fantastic! I would absolutely fly with them again the next time I book a trip." Pros: "The staff of ANA are so friendly and accommodating. When checking in, the woman at the counter moved me to a window seat from the middle, free of charge. They were very patient and helpful." Cons: "The food was a little strange, I had salmon and rice as “breakfast” with iceberg lettuce side salad. The pieces of salmon were little shreds with a funky taste. Not bad, but not what I wanted on a long red eye flight. Also I wish there’d been more Hollywood movie selections." Pros: "The flight was late checking in. The staff handled the situation well and kept the passengers informed." Pros: "Friendly attentive staff." Cons: "The seat was narrow and after 9 hours, not comfortable... Normal for economy though" Pros: "Crew was very friendly. Flight was on time. Meals were good. Will be flying with EVA again" Pros: "Comfortable" Cons: "Need more comfortable headsets or ability to use personal earphones." Pros: "Really happy as had a exit seat so lots of leg room" Cons: "The cabin crew was rude and the food ran out. The entertainment did not work. Plus we were over an hour late once we finally got off the plane" Pros: "The crew and food was great. The legroom not so great." Pros: "This is a bit weird, but it was the first time I flew Eva economy. I've taken this route many times in business and it would take pages to go through all the things that EVA does right in business class. So I was stunned when my first time in economy was so incredibly impressive as well." Cons: "I'm really picky and there's nothing more I could have wanted in an economy flight experience." Pros: "Boarding was delayed in Taipei although the flight made it in great time" Cons: "Website" Pros: "Clean plane" Cons: "Food was horrible, flight Attendants are professional but cold as ice." Cons: "No clothes to change. My fruits were expired because off the luggages not come to the destination." Pros: "Great fried fish for pre-ordered meal. Comfortable crew service for whole flight." Pros: "Good seats" Cons: "Took 2 hours from take off until i had a crew member ask what i wanted to eat/drink" Pros: "Excellent crew. Got on just in time. Last one on the flight but they were very understanding. Loved the airbus A380." Cons: "It was great but food could have been better. Process to get onto the flight at DXB was much longer and complicated than it needed to be. Huge airport and big distance between connecting flights." Pros: "The crew was amazing and their service was very attentive to customers." Cons: "Not having crying infants onboard" Pros: "Seat was fixed for such a long flight it is hazardous to the spine ." Cons: "Allow the seat to slightly recline like any other airline" Pros: "The crew were superlative." Cons: "The seat folded to a flat bed, yet the boulder area remained raised, making the comfort level for a tall person, somewhat rest cited. My neck really quite sore as a result. Was an old plane tho, and the controls for movies , seats etc were archaic" Pros: "The entertainment system was excellent and the free WiFi was good. The food was good, it was a bit more than expected as were the numerous beverages. The service was excellent." Cons: "The free WiFi was limited to a small amount of data or two hours." Pros: "I had 4 sectors except the first one 3 of them was with unfriendly cabin crew not smiling at all not responding the calls." Pros: "Business class setup Bar Staff" Cons: "Being seated 5 rows and a bulk head away from my wife. Configuration of Two class A380 business class is at the back of the plane with all that increased movement and you have to wait for economy to exit before you can get off. Your diluting the benefits guys for economy profits." Pros: "Love the A380 - the sheer size of it allowed for more personal space. Consequently, it was a much more comfortable flight." Pros: "Professionalism of flight and ground crew. Movie & entertainment selection. Overall cleanliness of aircraft. Better comfort due to wider seating." Cons: "The fact that this was the shortest flight of my trip - Wish my journey started this way." Pros: "The Q-suite is exceptionally comfortable and the door really does make a difference. I usually have difficulty sleeping but the isolation from aisle traffic and ambient noise reduction was enough to allow some very good sleep. Staff experience was also exceptional - friendly and highly competent, looking to go the extra mile. Food was great and full menu available upon request." Cons: "I did not find a gap" Pros: "Everything" Cons: "They are the best and air Canada should learn from them" Pros: "The service as usual on Qatar is excellent" Cons: "2-2-2 setup is old style for business class and while the seats were nice it means either you are stuck by the window or need to move to let others out in the aisle" Pros: "All crews are helpful especially to parents traveling with young kid." Cons: "More variety of food would be great" Pros: "Good Service.Efficient" Cons: "No Phone charging facilities on back of the seat unlike other Qatar aircraft." Pros: "The Crew was amazing. The Seat were the best Selling point fort business class" Cons: "More space for the arm rest ans legs space" Pros: "Good service/Crew food quality and choice good." Cons: "Need more choice of British TV Programmes rather than American" Pros: "Good leg space, friendly crew, excellent plane." Cons: "This is for ALL airlines: It takes so long to get off the plane!" Pros: "Plane was very empty so it allowed us to spread out." Cons: "Cabin noise was loud. There was a high pitched whine throughout the whole trip." Pros: "Gave food vouchers due to extended layover. Marché food quality is average at best." Cons: "Biggest problem was late arrival, missing connection. Lateness caused by them at first, then a departing passenger caused further delay. But they were late to begin with. Next problem was their REFUSAL to give me an aisle seat. I reserved an aisle seat originally, aisle seats were available when I tried to change, but agent REFUSED to accommodate me with either aisle or window. Sat in middle with huge guy next to me. Very uncomfortable. Food was mediocre on this leg. Oh, and late departing AGAIN. Will seriously look for other options on next trip."
