Definitely recommend getting one with private bathroom. Cons:The wifi was spotty throughout our stay. The air conditioner was supposed to be “automatic” and never turned on. Tried talking to hotel staff multiple times and of course the right person to fix it wasn’t there. Other guest complained about the heat too. hotel staff did nothing Location 23 Ave De La Porte De Chatillon, 75014 Paris What's nearby Luxembourg Gardens2.9 km Musée Rodin3.6 km Notre Dame4.1 km Sainte-Chapelle4.1 km Musée d’Orsay4.1 km Pont Neuf4.2 km Eiffel Tower4.3 km Louvre Museum4.4 km Jardins des Tuileries4.5 km Musée de l'Orangerie4.5 km Centre Pompidou4.9 km Champs-Elysées5 km Policies Check-in/Check-out Check in anytime after 2:00 PM, check out anytime before 12:00 PM Cancellation/prepayment Cancellation/prepayment policies vary by room type and provider.
