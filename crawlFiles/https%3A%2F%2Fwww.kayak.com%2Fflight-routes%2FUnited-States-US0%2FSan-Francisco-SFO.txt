Whats the point of social distancing when you have people directly behind you two feet away" Cons: "Flight was too crowded with customers only 4 feet apart during flight IN THE SAME ROW BUT NOT IN FRONT OR BEHIND YOU. Whats the point of social distancing when you have people directly behind you two feet away" Pros: "The crew was amazing and helpful, the plain was clean and pleasant flight" Cons: "Flight delay because we had to wait on a flight crew coming in on a different plane." Pros: "Crew went above and beyond!" Cons: "I still don’t like not having an assigned seat." Pros: "I liked getting off the plane" Cons: "A flight attendant was rude to me twice for no reason. It’s the first time this has ever happened wit SW" Cons: "The screeching noice from the broken speaker could have been fixed" Pros: "Very efficient and friendly crews; the flights were generally on time; boarding was easy (I paid the extra for early boarding)." Cons: "For the price, not much. Great value; very fair policies; overall really good experience." Cons: "The flight was constantly delayed, in the end we took off with more than a 3-hour delay without any explanation from Southwest. This is unacceptable!" Pros: "Flight was on time and arrived early. Crew knew what to do and made the flight run as smoothly as possible." Pros: "Crew was fun and lively - it was a quick trip!" Cons: "Wifi was out on the plane" Flight was cancelled, and we were stuck in LA for 36 hours. A crowded flight, everyone on the ground and in the air did their very best I don’t know if the flight attendant was having a bad day, but she could not have been any more sarcastic and rude. I am not sure if the script calls for announcing the snacks on board are pretzels, pretzels, pretzels, and if you ask, I’ll tell you we have pretzels, but that’s how she addressed people. Cons: "First class in an airplane this size is a bit limited (especially legroom) when in the first row." Pros: "Crew was very nice." Cons: "Consistency - nuts on way to Chicago were warm while on way back cold." Pros: "The crew was accommodating during the long delays boarding and deplaning:" Cons: "Delays were extremely long to the destination and upon arrival no gate was available for our plane which caused another long delay." Cons: "Flight on time and not wait 30 min on the runway to get to a gate once landed" Pros: "Crew was great" Cons: "My ticket should have automatically added my TSA precheck number as it's part of my profile. Was inconvenient to get back in line to get it added" Cons: "Everything was perfect, from taking off to landing, very smooth. Sweet cabin crew. Thank you for a safe flight" Pros: "Timing of the flight was always good. Efficient flying. Crew was super helpful too even when passengers were a bit too much." Cons: "the flight was 2 hours delayed but the staff continuously kept us up to date" Cons: "It was a 6 hour flight and I didn’t know only 2 snacks and a water were available on the plane until I got to the airport. Almost everything was still closed at the airport. We were quite hungry and thirsty." Cons: "Two very sick people were allowed to fly and were not denied boarding during these times of Covid19. We actually had to taxi back to terminal to remove a very sick passenger. JetBlue #100 March 17, 2020 10:12 pm from Los Angeles to Fort Lauderdale." Pros: "It has been over 2 years and I still remember the service, comfort and atmosphere of this flight. Whatever JetBlue is doing, it works!" Pros: "I liked the male flight attendants on my flight. They were nice and cheery and was always willing to help. The inflight entertainment and WiFi was great. The snacks were also good." Cons: "I forgot to the flight attendant’s name but she was quite rude. I traveled with an infant who required warming up of her milk in a bottle and I would ask for hot water and she failed to bring it over. I requested hot water twice. Initially when the plane was taking off- she stated she cannot bring anything while the flight was taking off but even after take off and in cruising altitudes she did not come over until we rang the call bell and another flight attendant came over. Second time mid flight we happen to ask the same flight attendant for hot water as she passed by— she nodded her head but again never returned with the hot water. Again I hit the call button and another attendant came over and gave me water. I felt that she did not like attending to the flight guests and always seemed to give an attitude. I understand traveling with a child may be hard for others, but imagine the parents who have to care for a starving baby. The flight was also a bit too warm." Pros: "Crew was very friendly and responsive" Cons: "Would’ve been nice if they offer headphones. Maybe they did and I just didn’t notice." Pros: "Love the free WiFi. That was awesome and somewhat unexpected." Cons: "There was no coffee left on board when serving the second round - kind of hard to wake up from a 6 hour flight." Pros: "Comfortable Mint seats. Not bad. Not cheap." Cons: "Breakfast selections were OK. They could do better for the price of Mint seats" Pros: "A 6+ hour flight is always tedious but jet Blue is always the best option, with live tv and a good supply of movies and snacks." Cons: "Quicker departure, 20 minutes on the tarmac, but that’s not the airline fault...FAA Boston" Pros: "Facilities and amenities (WiFi, unlimited snacks, comfortable seat)" Cons: "Gate agents consistently telling paxs to SIT DOWN if their boarding group hasn’t been called yet." I guess they don’t serve drinks on planes anymore Very efficient and effective. Fight crew and captain did a good job given the weather delays and turbulence… Pros: "Very friendly thank you!" Cons: "The wifi login experience could be improved. I purchased wifi as a guest when I had an account and had to spend extra time chatting with an agent to get it resolved. They were very helpful but having the option to login to my account at the start would be ideal!" Pros: "Kosher snacks! Thank you. Screens and outlets at every seat. Safe, controlled Covid protocols including de-boarding. Excellent!" Pros: "Delta flight took extra precaution to keep all passengers safe before during and after the flight. They communicate effectively during the flight. I will be flying Delta again and again." Cons: "The trip was great" Pros: "Crew was very friendly and took good care of the passengers" Pros: "Boarding process need to be improved. Seat assignment is horrible" Pros: "The crew went the extra mile to accomodate my bag due to not having a seat in front of me to stow it. Also, Delta Comfort was exceptional!" Cons: "We weren't alerted there was a chance of delays. Over two hours late." Cons: "Tightly packed seats made for discomfort. My knees were touching the seat in front of me." Pros: "The personal at counter very helpful." Cons: "Some information on website is unknown for call center people, like issues dealing with disabled people." Cons: "Rude check in employees, mediocre flight crew terrible food. Only good thing about the flight was the check in counter people at Asunción airport. The rest was so bad, will never flight with Avianca ever again." Pros: "decent comfort on board" Cons: "both flights delayed, some rude crew, and Avianca lost my luggage when I got to Medellin" Pros: "crew was wonderful but we sat on the runway the whole day and then they cancelled the flight" Pros: "The movie selection for children and adults was fine. The peach juice was good too." Cons: "The food was absolutely the most disgusting plane food I’ve had. I mean, airplane meals aren’t ever really that great but this was particularly foul. Also they should really stock the seat pockets with the nausea bags especially with all the turbulence over the Andes." Pros: "The crew was accommodating" Cons: "The seats were uncomfortable and they changed my flight 3 times" Pros: "Great service gave my brother all the attention he needed" Pros: "The plane and it was in time. I could sleep" Cons: "The arrival to bogota was a caos. We waited 2 hours to get immigration..." Cons: "A group of people including me, were waiting for our baggages for more than 30 minutes."
