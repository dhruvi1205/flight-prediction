Flight has no information regarding time to destination. Wish to have screen for international travels. Cons: "Food is served in heated plastic containers. I would request Qatar airways not heat the food in the plastic container." Pros: "Excellent service on both flights. Truly a 5 star experience. Well done Qatar Airways." Cons: "Nothing. Keep up the good work" Pros: "Staff are very polite and helpful (ground staff and in the air)." Cons: "The food was hit and miss. Some of it was good and some of it used ketchup as a sauce. The economy seats have been stripped down to budget airline level padding and the rows seem have been been jammed in a little closer." Pros: "Yes overall probably the best flight to Chennai from DC" Pros: "Justfly stoled my money as i booked for seat and paid 30$ And the seat didnt booked I want my money to be returned" Pros: "All the crews are awesome and very helpful, especially to the parents with young kid." Cons: "More variety and quality of food" Pros: "Food and entertainment was fine." Cons: "Crew was not very organized or helpful. Need more training/experience." Cons: "The flight got delayed which caused me to miss my connection flight. I was at the gate of my connection flight 5 minutes before the departure, however, they did not let me in. They transferred my flight and now I have to wait 24 hours for the next flight." Pros: "qatar airways" Cons: "serving alcohol to passengers more than once is disturbing the passengers on the side" Not exceptional but all good. Business class seats are like the domestic Mint class on Jet Blue. Comfortable but not exceptional. Food is good but not superb. Flight attendants were better on India leg than Miami to Zurich. All India staff was more professional and service oriented. Very polite and service with a smile. Crew took my carry on and checked it in; turned out to be a blessing; however the luggage was delayed at my final destination; receiving it 36 hours later. Thought, we'd get, at least water; but the Swiss chocolate was delicious. Thanks. Pros: "Food was good ." Cons: "Didnt turn on the AC until were in air, implying that everybody was sweating for 30min from boarding to ip in air. Crew refused Green Tea, saying it is only offered in Business class" Pros: "I did not receive a single email from kayak letting me know I could check in or select seats. No updates on flight status! Poor service!" Cons: "Email updates before flight! Not a single email sent!!" Pros: "the CREW WAS FRIENDLY AND CELEBRATING EASTER WITH THE GUESTS" Cons: "THE FOOD WAS ADEQUATE, GIVEN THAT WE WERE ON AN AIRPLANE" Pros: "Check in agent was extremely helpful in expediting both me and my bags after a late check-in. Flight attendants very friendly and helpful, food excellent. If Swiss Air flew everywhere I need to go, I would fly them every time!" Pros: "Same as above- wonderful crew, smooth take off and landing Very pleasant flight attendants the entire flight Service was great" Cons: "Again / wish all airlines had more comfortable seating in economy clas" Pros: "Quick, clean, flight." Cons: "Boarding delay due to mechanical problem. Line to board was more like a mass of people trying to squeeze through all at once and surprisingly disorganized. Somehow managed to board quickly, though." Pros: "The food and beverage service in Coach was great as usual ... The new 777 ER 300 was really a nice improvement over the aging Airbus planes previously flown Entertainment systems in coach were top notch with great entertainment choices to view ..." Cons: "3 4 3 seating results in very narrow isles ... during the longer flights on the 777 the isle seated passengers lean into the isles making going to and from the restrooms in ( coach) a bit of an obstacle course" Pros: "787 is an excellent plane and I could sleep a little" Cons: "I was boarding at gate C4. Doesn't anyone get it ! Using the word "bomb" in airports is a big no-no however C4 is OK? Even a little old lady knows what C4 stands for." Pros: "I like that there are multiple bathrooms onboard." Cons: "The rows are so narrow between seats that your roll on suitcase will not fit. You have no elbow room in your seat. People who live in England are very rude and would not let those of us seated in front of them to deplane. Too bad there isn’t someway to make people wait their turn." Pros: "Everything was easy" Cons: "Business class seats are snug for big people compared to other airlines" Pros: "The crew was outstanding and the good choices were excellent" Cons: "The flight was late( not their fault) and there were several technical difficulties with the A/C and entertainment system" Pros: "The crew was maybe average, that was still the best point." Cons: "Extremely tight space. The food was almost inedible. Awful." Cons: "at last minute itinerary was changed.. instead of routing through Brisbane, was now routed through Sydney. Flight from Sydney to LAX was delayed by 4 hours, then missed flight LAX to LAS... overall long delayed arrival. Checked the route through Brisbane, and those flights we're all there, departed and landed all on-time... so wondering what the reason was for the change of the itinerary without a cause (no cancel or delayed flights through Brisbane)" Pros: "Everything except the food" Cons: "The food is atrocious. Even if I have to pay to upgrade my meal, I would..." Pros: "The food was great. The flight attendants were very courteous and took excellent care of all passengers" Cons: "Long flight lol j/k can't help that. It was a great flight, no complaints" Pros: "Virgin Atlantic offers good service at a reasonable price to/from the US to London. Good food service and unbelieveable number of movies and entertainment to choose from." Cons: "The seating and leg room in economy classic were inadequate. We felt way too confined in our seats and the leg room was a joke. I am only 6' tall and this was unacceptable. We will try to upgrade for the return trip." Pros: "The ground staff was on top of it and the boarding process was smooth, but the cabin crew was brilliant. I’ve never had such pleasant service on a western airline. Well done. Entertainment system is top-notch, and the food was acceptable." Cons: "The booking process and paying for luggage is disappointing. Plus, I paid a $90 upgrade and just moved up two rows in the same section. Sneaky." Pros: "The crew was professional, responsive and friendly." Cons: "The following experience goes down in history as the worst ever because: we had a 3.5 year old child, and mom and dad seated directly in front of our row. The couple ignored the instructions to move seats forward during meals making it impossible to eat. They placed their luggage in the overhead compartment belonging to both rows, which wasn't a problem if they hadn't proceeded to open and close the compartment every 20 minutes. The 300 pd dad repeatedly stepped on my broken toe while reaching for his luggage, while rattling around and disturbing sleeping passengers. And, sadly the child repeatedly threw temper tantrums without any care or effort of intervention from the parents. In short, they terrorized the surrounding travellers. In contrast, my outbound flight, also had a family seated in the row directly in front. This family was the antithesis, considerate and respectful of their fellow passengers. Susan Laws" I wouldn't say I liked being forced to check my small roller bag at the gate; too many people had bags and were in a higher boarding group. Cons: "Passengers not jumping up as soon as we reached the gate even though they were asked to stay seated until their route was next off." Pros: "Crew was professional and understanding/empathetic given the circumstances. We were delayed 4 hrs." Cons: "While the weather delay was out of everyone’s control and it was obvious the pilot was doing everything he could to get the pale airborne... i feel their could have been better communication from the ground as to our take off time. They kept changing our time and thus we were trapped on the tarmac for 4 hrs. Had we known, some of us could have gotten off the plane and rerouted so as not to miss our connecting flight. We and others were stuck in Atlanta, had t okay for a hotel....and missed a day of vacation....☹️" Pros: "The crew was very attentive and had great personality. They anticipated any needs we had." Pros: "The crew was understanding and sympathetic to the customer's frustration with a delayed flight." Cons: "Delta should have figured out a way to not delay the flight. Every flight was delayed." Pros: "The plane was nice" Cons: "I’m still sitting in Minneapolis so I would have liked to be at my destination. And I had to pay for the overnight accommodations." Pros: "Entertainment was awesome. Although airlines are stingy with snacks, Delta had a good overall selection and very generous." Cons: "Something that cant be changed overnight, however, there should be a little more Aisle space for folks pass through as my shoulder was getting beat up after every passing person and cart." Pros: "Crew was friendly." Cons: "Wish the seat was more comfortable. Landing was jittery and bumpy." Pros: "Seats are comfortable, crew was great, overall a smooth flight" Cons: "The fact that airlines are trying to charge for every little add-on is pretty annoying. 2 dollars for headphones? Don't even get me started with their snack boxes..." Pros: "The flight attendant from IAD to MSP called Bernadette was wonderful!" Cons: "everything sucked time bery bad servive starfed on flight nonacolok was sergvedngypu ilt was really disappoinyling includigbymkthrvlounhr aothee airlione" Pros: "Nice plane , nice crew. Ok food , not as good as Sfo to Ist ." Cons: "We left delayed as it seemed they were waiting for someone. Older 777 wich shows wear." Cons: "Too warm, chaotic boarding, not enough baggage space, airline couldn’t upgrade me at the gate with miles." Pros: "The food and entertainment were okay." Cons: "The staff was rude. The entertainment consoles didn’t work well." Pros: "I liked the food and the staff were very friendly" Pros: "The entertainment was excellent!" Cons: "The comfort level for that long of a flight was very poor. Seats are way too close together. There is no knee room from the seats at the front at all. People operating their video monitor is a disturbing fact for the passengers who sits in front of them." Pros: "The entertainment and services of crew" Cons: "The vegetarian food was not that good..it can be made better." Pros: "Amazing food. Can't believe how good the desserts were. Entertainment also top notch." Pros: "Service was exceelent and all crew staff were professional and friendly and courteous." Pros: "Excellent STAR lounge in Istanbul Good service, once settled. Friendly staff." Cons: "On line check-in system does not remember frequent flier info. Passport check at gate was poorly managed. Everyone was in waiting area then told to get out and stand in line for passport check. It happened each time so this seems to be their normal process. On flight back they bused us to the airplane and waited for all three buses to arrive at the airplane before allowing anyone to board. Flight attendants helped with moving carry on bags in bins but with little consideration to the items. Completely unorganized boarding process to the point it is worth paying a little more to fly a different airline."
