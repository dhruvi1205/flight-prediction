KAYAK’s top tips for renting a car in Victoria Renting a car in Victoria lets you explore the city and its surroundings on your own schedule without having to pay for cabs or face the crowds in public transports. Perched on the edge of Vancouver Island, the city has lots of places you can drive to such as Beacon Hill Park. A rental car is also perfect for discovering other destinations outside Victoria, including the scenic route to nearby Saanich Peninsula, which is only 45 minutes away. All the big car rental agencies can be found at Victoria International Airport (YYJ), which is located approximately 25 km (15.5 miles) north of Victoria. Car rental services are situated in the arrivals hall of the airport's passenger terminal, straight across from the Information Desk. Handicap hand controls are available with some companies when requested in advance. Victoria itself is a fairly easy city to navigate, but remember that traffic signs will be expressed in kilometers rather than miles. If you're heading to other destinations outside the city, beware that some back roads may be trickier, especially in the winter months. Vancouver Island is also popular among cyclists, so be extra careful when driving through the area. Traffic around Victoria usually flows nicely throughout the whole day, especially when compared to other big cities in Canada and the U.S., but driving into or out of the city during morning or evening rush hour can be a bit chaotic. Avoid driving into the city between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. and out of the city between 4 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. 25% of our users found rental cars in Victoria for C$ 38 or less Book your rental car in Victoria at least 1 day before your trip in order to get a below-average price Off-airport rental car locations in Victoria are around 32% cheaper than airport locations on average Supplier choice rental cars in Victoria are around 46% cheaper than other car types, on average Victoria car rental experiences: the best tips from KAYAK users Insights shared by verified travelers who rented a car in Victoria Learn how KAYAK collects reviews and tips from users. Verified travelerOct. 2023 Option to take Brentwood ferry is a lovely alternative to heading North driving through Vancouver. Verified travelerSep. 2023 Make sure all damage is documented when picking up the vehicle! Verified travelerOct. 2023 Pick up and return outside rush hours. Verified travelerAug. 2023 Renting a car is far superior (both logistically and frequently in cost, too) to bringing your own car on the ferry from Port Angeles. The exception would be if you are planning on spending days driving up island. A car downtown is nothing but a big parking fee. But if you must park downtown the Empress garage is convenient and surprisingly reasonably priced. Rent a car for a trip to Butchart Gardens- you can stay as long as you want, and even come back in the evening to see the Gardens after dark, a totally different experience than seeing them in daylight. AzaadJul. 2023 If staying downtown lots of parking options ranging from $15-30 per day and didn’t have any major concerns about vehicle safety or auto crime. Meter parking also an option (pay 8am-8pm and free otherwise). Not a difficult place to drive and I recommend renting a vehicle if you like to check out nearby parks, lakes, and outdoor activities in addition to seeing the city amenities. JohnsonJun. 2023 National car service a the airport was very quick anded convenient and the employees at National were terrific!! Being treated politely and with respect was very much appreciated! I would recommend renting from National in Victoria! Verified travelerJul. 2023 Know where you are going and where are the parkings located in advance Verified travelerAug. 2023 Easy to find - go first inside the airport to find agent. Verified travelerAug. 2023 Try National on Courtney Street before you try anywhere else. Verified travelerJun. 2023 Before parking, must care to pay enough bill.

He helped me a great deal by finding me a van available at the airport so I could not be more grateful! Very polite, kind, helpful and provided a lot of information to a newcomer to Victoria! I would rent a vehicle from them again! 7.6 Good Oct. 2020 Cons:There were scratches on the car that weren't reported. 10.0 Wonderful Dec. 2019 Pros:Friendly staff, excellent location, nice comfortable vehicle. Cons:A little difficult to return the vehicle due to one way roads not easily maneuverable but on the 2nd go-around we figured out how to get into the lot and through the road construction. Nice staff, but they really scrutinize the vehicle so take pictures before you drive off the lot. 7.6 Good Jul. 2019 Pros:The drop off was convenient. Cons:We went to National twice after driving a distance to get there and were not able to add a second driver either time. Misinformation, computer system down, nobody there. Very frustrating,. 3.6 Poor Jul. 2019 Cons:Damage check when returning felt like a criminal investigation. It ended up fine, but seemed like they were really trying to find insignificant damage to hold you accountable for.
