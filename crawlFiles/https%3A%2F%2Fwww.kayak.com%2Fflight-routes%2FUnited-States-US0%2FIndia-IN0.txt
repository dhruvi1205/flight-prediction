Pros: "Inflight entertainment was superb, catering in main cabin was also excellent. The crew was friendly and professional." Cons: "Main cabin seats were definitely better than other airlines, but still not the most comfortable for 8+ hours." Cons: "Crew missed our rows a couple of times with drinks. Seat on flight from Dubai to Sydney not vey comfortable," Pros: "Crew was a little curt in giving instructions - open that window ma’am" Cons: "I requested the meal a little later cause I was asleep... but she said not possible. I would e been ok with a cold meal a little later cause I wasn’t feeling well. Would’ve appreciated a little understanding." Pros: "Good choice of entertainment." Cons: "Food can be improved. A little bit of innovation is needed." Pros: "Plane was clean, on time and pleasant seats. Staff was attentive but not exceptional. We landed early! WiFi was free for a bit but very slow. Variety of entertainment was excellent." Cons: "Entertainment system was excessively complex for no good reason. Seats were about average for business class. Screens were older and too far. Sound system was subpar." Pros: "Comfortable seats with pillows, blanket and good foods" Cons: "The thing which was not good was the service. I would say that service should be done fairly not to see the people background so I asked for something but the crew did bring that. I would suggest to work on this portion. Thanks" Pros: "Love the A380 - the sheer size of it allowed for more personal space. Consequently, it was a much more comfortable flight." Pros: "Footrest would make the flight just perfect." Cons: "No footrest. Makes it a little uncomfortable for short people." Pros: "The crew and attempt to help with anything I needed" Cons: "Limited leg room for a big guy like me. My cancelled flight from Boston to phx was too long of a layover" Bus from gate to plane waited more than 30 minutes in a freezing temperatures of a/c. Plane temperature was very cold . Sitting arrangement is very poor and for entertainment options for Bollywood fans , need to add more movies and Hindi TV shows . Bcz mostly Indian people are spend more money to fly with Qatar so for their better entertainments please add more good TV shows . Thank you Pros: "Amazing crew i must give it to them... super hospitality." Cons: "for now non, may be later after much observations, other than that... it was excellent !!" Cons: "My flight time was changed but I didn’t receive any email regarding the change" Cons: "No toilet available at gate due to enhanced security measures when flying to the USA." Pros: "Food is delicious" Cons: "Paid WIFI this time was horrible for the half of the trip WIFI don’t work" Cons: "Food from New York to doha was average. Doha to Karachi excellent. Over all it was excellent experience. People on the ground at doha airport was exceptional. Very courteous and ready to go serve. This is what I call real service." Cons: "Plane was too warm and movie selection was the same for all flights. Too many marvel kid movies." Pros: "Boarding was efficient. Staff were polite and helpful." Cons: "Food was okay, seats were less so. Not enough leg room." Pros: "Yes overall probably the best flight to Chennai from DC" Simply the best way to get nonstop to Europe. if you’re lucky, there’s clear skies with views of Arctic or the aurora at night. 1 of the best flights I have ever had with Lufthansa. Superb crew, good food, comfortable seat and climate, very good entertainment system. Plane left 1 hour and 30 min late due to a faulty gate at the airport . they should have changed the gate immediately and minimize the delay. Due to this fact I lost my connection in Munich and ended up staying 12h in the airport . I got rebooked and for the troubles i got a 15 euro voucher witch is barely enough to buy a bottle of water in the airport . A bottle of water is 6 to 7 euros in the airport a sandwich is 12 to 20 euros . a sleep cabin is 17 to 20 an hour . their compensation is mediocre at least it has not changed the amount in the past 10 years , where the prices since then have . On top of this on my return they broke both of my check in bags another 500 USD damage Pros: "Crew" Cons: "More direction once crew knew the connecting flight would be lost, especially to minors" Pros: "Friendly and professional staff, comfortable and on-time flight." Cons: "Clear up-front notification about first checked bag not being included in ticket price. This info did not appear at the time the booking was made. Very frustrating." Pros: "Crew was great! Food was good! Boarding was fast and organized!" Pros: "The flight was adequate." Cons: "Sandwich was extremely unappetising and there were no hot drinks. The worst thing was that in transiting from the SAA flight to the Lufthansa flight we were obliged to go through security which seems unnecessary. The security staff were awful. Bullying, rude and totally unsympathetic to the fact that having brought water from the first plane to the second plane we had to either drink it or throw it away. One guy in particular, a tall greying man evoked the worst stereotypes of brutal secret policemen. Perhaps he formerly worked for Stasi or he was having testosterone problems. Totally unacceptable behaviour." Pros: "I like my trip - good service, good food (vine, whiskey :-) )" Cons: "We were put on standby. We expected our names to be called for seat assignments but we didn’t expect we could just swipe our boarding pass and our seat assignment would show. It’s a nice feature but I didn’t like that it wasn’t clearly explained to us." Pros: "Flight went smoothly with no issues or problems. Flight attendants were nice & helpful Thank you" Cons: "The only thing I could complain about was the tv screen wasn’t working & attendant tried to fix but the headphones never worked," The service and courtesy of the flight attendants was good. The check in staff were ok. Seat on the flight uncomfortable. Pros: "Everything..." Cons: "There wasn’t any entertainment on this flight though which made the time a little difficult to pass..." Pros: "N/A" Cons: "Boarding was very poorly managed. Did not board using zones and kept standing for up to 30-40 mins on the aero bridge." Pros: "The seat. The BC lounge , the A380 BC. The food the service all ex excellent !" Cons: "The crew wasn’t friendly at all, not personal at all , I even brought chocolates all the way from California and only got a thank you from one cabin crew. Not friendly or personal at all" Pros: "in the AUH-MAD leg, i thought the headrests were great—perfect for sleeping" Cons: "in the MNL-AUH leg, the touchscreen entertainment system didn’t always work" Cons: "Boarding was chaotic. In seat entertainment had great selection, but dated screens." Pros: "The crew was terrible. The aircraft from AUH to bangalore was in bad condition. My seat would keep coming back if reclined, my neighbour’s seat wouldn’t recline." Cons: "The airport in Abu Dhabi was a mess! There was zero organisation and etihad ground staff were not managing things either. My bag came back broken!" Pros: "Good aircraft" Cons: "Check in could not be done earlier and was not enabled and helpdesk did not help. Seats kept changing till the last moment" Cons: "My Baggiage is extremely damaged which is so disgusting and there is no way to report it" Pros: "Good news, the checking in process was so delayed as there were so many people, they made sure all who checked in, got on the plane, no hitches on the lugguages either. I got my lugguage in Singapore." Cons: "JFK to Singapore through Abu Dhabi. The checking in process at JFK was a mess, it was a full flight. There were many people, trying checking in. Two lines, (1) checking in. (2) checked in, dropping off bags. Some of us who had checked in online was trying to drop off bags only. After waiting 1.5 hours, this line isn't moving at all, while the checking in line was moving. Tried telling the gentlemen in charge who worked there that the checked in line dropping off bagguage was not moving, he didn't really care, they made all kinds of excuses saying other people were waiting, so they were completely clueless as to what was going on. I have never experienced this ever and I fly massively each year. First and last time in Etihad. JFK to Abu Dhabi is a good 13 hour flight. NO SNACKS. SG/BA, or any other airline really has nice sandwishes, ramen, chocolate, cookies, chips. Etihad has NOTHING. Not that I snack but still with a 13 to 14 hour flight, airlines should have something to eat during long flights. Really. Etihad who brands and advertises brilliantly, was extremely disppointing to actually be on the flight." Pros: "Crew was good. Seats suck. Mine was not even working. Had to call the crew 4-5 times to recline and upright." Cons: "No wifi, no entertainment, bad seats." Pros: "Seat was not at all comfortable. Checked in bag was found damaged when it arrived at belt in kochi. Officials didn’t bother to lodge a report." Pros: "1 check in bag missed. Launched the complaint and still no use." Cons: "Make sure no bags misssed" Cons: "The flight was delayed 1.5 hrs. Causing me to barely make it to my transfer. Air India is notoriously bad on punctuality" Cons: "Proper meal for lunch but for dinner we were given snack foods (croissant, fruit salad and chocolate cake). Also my bag got left in Delhi as I had a fast transfer - Got it back but it was quite stressful!" Cons: "Leg room was poor. All the aisle and window seats were being sold at extra rates. Entertainment system was pre-historic with very limited choices. Food was bland and nothing appealing. The staff, for most part was invisible. They appeared during the serving of the meals and then vanished." Pros: "Good enough for 1.5 hour flight, drinks and food were provided." Pros: "I appreciated that SOME of the crew tried to help us with our defective monitors by resetting them, but it didn’t work. The landing was also incredibly smooth. Top marks to the pilot." Cons: "Our monitors and remotes did not work at all, for the entire flight. What’s worse, is the monitors weren’t just black... they were stuck on a bright white screen which were constantly in our face and prevented us from sleeping. Towards the end of the flight, out of desperation for sleep, I placed my blanket over the three defective monitors so the two other people in my row and I could try and sleep, but I was yelled at by a stewardess because she considered it a fire hazard! She was completely unsympathetic. Having a blinding white light in your face rather than an entertainment system, on a 14 hour flight, was torturous. My girlfriend and I were EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED in this flight. The food was also very underwhelming and akin to bad hospital food. But at least that was bearable." Pros: "The food, courtesy of the staff, chai" Cons: "The entertainment system control was clunky and put together with scotch tape. The down arrow didn't work, so my choices were limited and poor. I gave up and spent the flight without any entertainment." Pros: "The flight crew was awesome. Very friendly and welcoming. Served well even in between the scheduled service" Cons: "Flight was delayed by 5 hours. No reason given other than operational issues. What does that mean? All airport staff sucked at both airports. SFO more so. They broke my bag. There was no agents around for an hour.. Then they said 40$ is the maximum they pay for a broken bag!"
