The Philippines has a rule that requires the use of a child restraint system, which implies a child seat or booster seat. Therefore, if you will be using a private car or rental car from MNL, ensure you have a child seat or booster seat, depending on the age of your kid. All car rentals in Manila avail child seats, infant seats, and booster seats at a small fee per day. Do you require a visa to fly to the Philippines? You will not require a visa when booking flights to the Philippines if you are visiting the country for a period not exceeding 30 days. This applies to all travellers visiting the Philippines for different purposes, including tourism and business. Are there direct flights from Canada to the Philippines? Philippine Airlines offers direct flights to the Philippines from Toronto Pearson International Airport (YYZ) and from Vancouver International Airport (YVR). The flights arrive at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila, which is the biggest airport in the Philippines. Which flights to the Philippines with a layover are the most convenient? Air Canada and Cathay Pacific offer flights to the Philippines with a short layover in Hong Kong, arriving either at Manila Airport or at Mactan-Cebu International Airport. Several Asian national carriers such as Japan Airlines, China Eastern and Korean Air also offer one-stop flights from Canada to the Philippines with a layover in their respective cities. Where should I fly to in the Philippines? All direct flights from Canada and the US will arrive at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila. This gives travellers easy access to Manila and the surrounding areas, and serves as the hub for other domestic airlines such as Air Asia Philippines, Cebu Pacific and Philippine Airlines. If you travel to the Philippines with a layover in a neighbouring country, you might want to choose a flight to Cebu Airport. From there, you can easily access the centrally located tourist islands such as Bohol and Boracay. Do I need a visa to visit the Philippines? Canadian passport holders do not need a tourist or business visa for a stay of up to 30 days. Upon arrival, you have to present a valid Canadian passport and a return ticket to Canada or an onward ticket to your next destination. If you want to stay longer than 30 days, you can apply for an extension at the Philippines Bureau of Immigration within the 30-day period. Be aware that you have to pay a departure fee of ₱750 (approximately C$ 20) in Manila and ₱850 (approximately C$ 22) in Cebu. How long is the flight to the Philippines?

The primary arrival airport for flights to the Philippines is Manila International Airport (MNL), which serves as the gateway to Manila. The other major arrival airport for flights to the Philippines is Clark International Airport (CRK). The advantage of landing at MNL is that it puts you in the capital of the Philippines, Manila, with a wide range of transport options for convenient connections to other cities. Choosing a less popular route for flights to the Philippines increases your chances of getting cheaper flight deals. The route that has Clark International Airport as the arrival airport is less popular compared to the one that has MNL as the arrival airport. Additionally, landing at CRK comes with the advantage of shorter queues at the airport shuttles’ stops, baggage claim areas, and security checkpoints. Most of the airlines offering flights to the Philippines make two stops before arriving at the destination airport. Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) and Incheon International Airport (ICN) are the main layover airports for multiple airlines offering flights to the Philippines. However, your journey will be shorter if you book Air Canada or ANA, which makes only one stop before arriving in the Philippines. The Philippines is home to over 7,000 islands, so generally travellers require more than one flight over the duration of their trip. Manila Airport (MNL) is the main international hub, where you can catch flights to other domestic locations such as the centrally located Mactan-Cebu International Airport (CEB) on Cebu Island, or Davao International Airport (DVO) in the South. If you plan on visiting the world famous Banaue Rice Terraces in the northern part of Luzon Island, you can either fly to Manila Airport and travel by bus (a 10-12h ride) or consider flying to Cauayan Airport (CYZ), where you can arrange a private transfer from the airport (approximately 2h). To explore Tubbataha Marine Park, consider flying into Puerta Princesa Airport (PPS) in the province of Palawan. From there you can reach the park and reef by boat. To explore the chocolate hills on the island of Bohol, you can fly into Cebu Airport, the major hub for the Central Philippines, and take a ferry to Bohol Island. Holy Week is the longest festival in the Philippines and starts on Palm Sunday, in either March or April. Be aware that flight and hotel prices tend to increase during this period.

I was disappointed and sad because of the damaged of my luggage. They should replace it or fixed it. Pros: "Crew was attentive." Cons: "Was seated near some noisy distractions i.e. crying baby." Pros: "Service, entertainment, and seats are all great." Cons: "Korean airlines could use air nodules for their seats as both flights became very hot towards the end." Pros: "Great crew, good food, easy to watch entertainment , and food better than most airlines" Cons: "Let me change my ticket due to a death in the family." Pros: "Very comfortable seats. Ability to pre-order meals to meet dietary restrictions." Cons: "Another protein choice to go with fruit tray. More offers of water and other drinks throughout the flight." Pros: "The flight was shared with Delta airlines on a Delta plane, terrible arrangements. Small seats, poor service, poor entertainment, very bad experience." Cons: "It could have been better if it was a Korean Air flight." Pros: "Excellent service and probably the most efficient boarding process I’ve ever been a part of. Food service went by without a hitch, and the stewardesses knew English very well so we felt comfortable and welcomed. I also really liked being able to get terminal/travel information from the infotainment system. Being that I’ve never been to ICN or NRT before, having access to terminal maps and basic instructions on how to find connecting flights and baggage claim areas was probably one of the most helpful features of the flight!" Cons: "I am 5’11” and found my seat somewhat uncomfortable. It didn’t detract from being able to sleep at all, but it did seem like the seats on this airline might be at its most comfortable with shorter passengers." Pros: "Friendly crew, good food, roomy in economy (especially as the middle seat was not occupied)." Cons: "Very limited movie/entertainment selection." All went well with my flight I would recommend this to anyone who asked how my flight was Pros: "The crew was very friendly and helpful." Cons: "I am unable to eat dairy products so I choose the vegetarian meal thinking that would be my best option however it had cheese and butter in the food so I couldn't eat most of what was served." Cons: "plane was 2 hours late, which sucks. they don't tell you it is going to be 2 hours late. you couldn't enter the boarding area (in Taiwan airport) until one hour before departure. if you you are familiar with Taiwan airport, then you know the a then they tell you the plane will be another hour late." Pros: "The crew are efficient and helpful. The food is good too." Cons: "Hope they have anime movie in the choice" Pros: "Very accomodating crew. One of the nicer airlines I’ve flown on. Newer, well maintained clean aircraft." Pros: "Being able to check bags and get boarding pass at Taipei Main station prior to boarding MRT (similar to Hong Kong) is a very useful convenience. EVA staff there were extremely pleasant and helpful." Pros: "None" Cons: "Seat space is too small. When serving drink and food, the crew put drinks tray above my head ,and passing food to other passenger right on top of my foods, I have to stop to eat . EVA Crews need to be train, learn how to more respectful, more professional...." Pros: "Late night flight, crew was good and timely" Cons: "I got sick from the spaghetti dinner served 2 hrs before landing." Pros: "EVA Air has just got it figured out, solid from boarding to departure" Cons: "Faster airplanes, or I could pick shorter trips" Pros: "1. Kind and accommodating flight attendants 2. The provided earbuds/earphones are great since they provide a bit of noise cancelling or at least block out extra noise" Pros: "In flight entertainment was quite good" Cons: "I was offered an earlier flight departing from London, which was good but was delayed in the end. But I was not told my connecting flight was changed too (new boarding pass not issued and I only realized from the baggage slip) - I had to pay 100 usd to change flights again!" Pros: "Amazing crew. Very attentive and great service. Wonderful flat bed seats" Cons: "The check in counter service is terrible. Very unprofessional with terrible attitude. Can not pronounce the gate number clearly. After I clear up with him, he started gossiping with his colleague as it was my fault for not comprehending his English. How did Cathay Pacific become this way?" Pros: "The flight attendants were kind and attentive and professional. I enjoyed being able to watch movies of my choice. Great selection of entertainment available. Food was good and the Hagen Daze ice cream was a great surprise!" Cons: "I’m thin but 177cm tall (long legs) so the seats were wide but leg room was uncomfortable for me. Also, the posture of the seats are not good for spinal or neck alignment so, again not comfortable. No support for the lower back and very limited reclinablity." Pros: "Our flight was delayed 45 in Chicago due to ice on the wings. Then about 10 mins of holding to land. With a 90 min lay over, unboarding and reboarding was rushed......but Cathay and security did their best I feel, It was only a 90 min flight and I didn't eat or watch a movie." Cons: "Again, being 6-4, I struggle with comfort and after having no time to rest while switching planes, I was exhausted when I arrived in Manila." Pros: "The seats were comfortable with enough leg room even in Economy class. I was late to go through security check-in, but the flight waited for me to board the flight. The on-flight entertainment was excellent." Cons: "I didn't like the food offered that much. Also, it seemed that the crew were not that good in coordinating among themselves and helping out passengers. There was not much option on drinks." Pros: "crew was courteous and highly helpful. food was good, served hot." Pros: "Except for one time service everything else is good" Cons: "Staff forgot what I have asked for boarding could have been done using zones." Cons: "Original itinerary was not followed. Plane from manila to hongkong left late and was transferred to a different flight for hongkong to Auckland .Seats not even together. Was put on 2 lay overs instead of just 1 (hongkong to Aussie then Aussie to Auckland. With no compensation at all. Sorry is not enough." Pros: "Not much, quick though" Cons: "Plane is old, seats are terrible, hard awkward, strange seatbelt clunk of foam plastic, food was horrible, never saw the crew, it was hot, needed water has to go track it down, it was an overnight flight so not all the crews fault" Pros: "The flight was a great value for the price and the staff was amazing and attentive." Cons: "The vegetarian meals were pretty bad and I felt like the entertainment selection wasn’t great." Cons: "The cabin temperature was a bit too warm, I sweated a bit during mid flight from the heat." Cons: "The temperature inside the cabin was too hot! It was warm and hot enough that chocolate I bought at duty free before the flight was melted!!" Pros: "They ran things efficiently and staff was cordial and helpful if asked." Cons: "I didn't realize I was assigned middle seats for.both legs of my long 20 hour trip. It would have been nice if the person checking me in would have considered assigning me a different seat on at least one of the legs. It was fine just not amazing." Pros: "Food was slightly better than the previous flight." Cons: "Same lousy headphones. My seat had a led rest that made it harder to get in and out, and wasnt usable due to the close distance to the seat in front. What was the designer thinking? I missed the drink service if there was one, never saw water going around until right at the end. . ." Pros: "Amazing lady who worked at the counter. So fast and efficient. I’ve never seen such efficiency at any airline before. Thank you." Pros: "Good service, onboard entertainment" Cons: "Twice now I didn't get the seat I reserved at the time of ticketing." Cons: "This was my first time travelling with China airlines and this trip was our honeymoon so we were really excited for this trip but after flying with China Air, I dont think I will fly with them again. Flight attendants were really rude, Food was ok, There’s no selection of drinks" Pros: "Sitting in the emergency row." Cons: "More veg. meal options. Please make sure to offer a complete balanced meal, not just a serving of veggies." Cons: "Food was some of the worst airline food I’ve had. I had the vegetarian options and the vegetables were very bland and over cooked. I usually like airplane food." The checkin was unacceptable. Agent took about 3-5 min minutes with me, standing in front of her, and not in acknowledging my presence. Finally, when she started processing my check in as a priority passenger, she neglected to give me a lounge pass until I reminded her . when I went to the lounge, they didn’t have me registered. However, the agent there still accepted me Did not tag my luggage as priority, so I had to wait until almost the very end before my luggage appeared. My Wi-Fi as premier elite did not work. This was not a good start to my lengthy flight. Pros: "Movie selection was ok" Cons: "Ran out of meals offered me crackers and bread boarding was a mess long delays I will never fly Philippines airline again!" Pros: "Flight was on time boarding and arriving" Cons: "1). Didn’t have enough food so only one option was available 2.) seats cramped like a budget airline 3.). Pilot made a harsh landing." Pros: "Good crew" Cons: "Food was terrible ride was bumpy and no entertainment was provided" Cons: "The new boarding gate could have been made clearer. But it was a great flight. Great entertainment. 144 movies to choose from. Great." Pros: "Crew was cold but quite busy." Cons: "Checking in was very slow and boarding process was very poor!" Pros: "Sit is average small" Cons: "Food was terrible, need to improve for the food quality" Pros: "Though we are 50 mins late in departure we were given announcement early" Cons: "The food we had ( fish and rice) for the flight was enough in quntity but lack a good taste." Pros: "Flight took off early landed early" Cons: "The seats obviously and the nead trolley dolly was quite rude she spoke about me to another passenger like i wasnt tgere" Pros: "Crew was fine food mediocre" Cons: "Leg room is real tight. Hardly any space to move. Compared to other airlines the A320-200 Philippine Airlines aircraft has been packed with way too many seats. Will not fly them again."
