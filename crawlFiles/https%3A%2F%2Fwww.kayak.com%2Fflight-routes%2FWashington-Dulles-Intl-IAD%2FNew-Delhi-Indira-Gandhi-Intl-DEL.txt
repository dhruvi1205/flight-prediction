Cons: "I have requested seafood for my meals. Unfortunately I was told that no such request was mentioned on the list as special meal. Overall the food was okay, we had 2 small pieces of beef in one meal, the two salads has no taste and the sandwich was too salty. A passenger who sat next to my husband snored all the time and leaned a bit over my husband as he was heavy." Pros: "Fantastic flight...Qatar’s QSuites are fantastic, very comfortable, Amazon my service from the crew, fantastic entertainment options, and with the privacy of the suite ...very close to first class...in fact it is better than the first products (from a seat perspective) of many other airlines such as United, Delta, Virgin, BA, etc." Cons: "I wish there were more vegetarian options on the menu" Cons: "I had been told my checkin bags will be available at final destination but I had to pick them up at Delhi and do the checking in once more which was a lot of hassle with kids" Pros: "The entertainment was good without any hiccups" Cons: "The crew was in a hurry burry which didn’t give a very good experience. I would suggest the crew to be little more tolerant and make their customers feel good.foo" Pros: "Food was ok" Cons: "AC was not turned on until flight was up in air. That means for 30 minutes passengers were sweating sitting in a suffocating cabin. Crew refused to give Green Tea, saying only available in business class Inflight screen size was very small ...5-6 inches only" Pros: "the CREW WAS FRIENDLY AND CELEBRATING EASTER WITH THE GUESTS" Cons: "THE FOOD WAS ADEQUATE, GIVEN THAT WE WERE ON AN AIRPLANE" Pros: "The crew was great!

The air hostesses were not as helpful as other airlines." Pros: "People were friendly. Flight was comfortable." Cons: "Staff incorrectly assessed documents needed for visas, and told us we were incomplete and needed to return home.

Also, we got bug bites during the flight that turned out to be from bed bugs, which followed us home and caused much frustration for months." Pros: "Crew was great !!!" Cons: "Seating in upper class is uncomfortable and bedding is not fresh." Pros: "The business class seats are the best we’ve had. Plenty of room, nicely laid out, good organization design. The blankets were fluffy and very comfortable. Crew was super attentive and friendly. For such a long flight, it was very pleasant, will highly recommend." Cons: "Nobody was sat in the overwing emergency exit row seats for the whole flight (so nobody had been briefed on how to use them) and the tray tables for these seats were down during the flight effectively blocking the emergency exit in the event of an emergency. Potentially very dangerous" Pros: "Meals were excellent and plane was very clean. Economy delight is definitely an upgrade worth considering with extra leg room and space in front of you in general." Cons: "Boarding can get crowded so don't be in a rush" Pros: "Fabulous flight, light on passengers, so excellent service given by the crew. Virgin goes the extra mile on service and little perks. 747-400 planes also very comfortable, compared to the Airbus 320," Cons: "Nothing. Trip both ways were outstanding." Pros: "Crew was very nice. Food was very good and plentiful. Entertainment was good. Overall the very long flight was better than expected." Cons: "It took forever to board in Sydney with all passengers standing and waiting for 45 minutes and never being told what was going on. I resented having my passport and ticket demanded at least 4 times. A bit overkill and a power trip by security. Absolutely despise airport security...there is no uniformity." Pros: "Everything (with the exception of the subject below), thank you. One thing that really surprised me, though, is how much I liked the eggs (on both flights) and what went with the eggs, like the spinach and potatoes and bacon on this flight and the potatoes and sausage (and was there something else?) on the next flight. Kudos for making something that has got to be cheap taste good. Thanks." Cons: "Come to think of it, there was one thing that I didn't particularly like, and that was how the headphones only worked on one side only (there was only audio on one side). At first I thought that maybe I had just gotten bad headphones, but the my next flight was the same: the headphones also only played audio on one side." Pros: "I loved the in flight entertainment, and there was always so many snacks and drinks available for free!" Cons: "For boarding, we had to walk a rather far distance due to construction." Pros: "Virgin Atlantic offers good service at a reasonable price to/from the US to London. Good food service and unbelieveable number of movies and entertainment to choose from." Cons: "The seating and leg room in economy classic were inadequate. We felt way too confined in our seats and the leg room was a joke. I am only 6' tall and this was unacceptable. We will try to upgrade for the return trip." I wouldn't say I liked being forced to check my small roller bag at the gate; too many people had bags and were in a higher boarding group. Pros: "Entertainment" Cons: "Flight wasn't full. I could have been seated somewhere else since passenger next to me was quite large and invading my personal space" Pros: "The crew was very attentive and had great personality. They anticipated any needs we had." Pros: "Most comfortable seats of the three flights. Crew friendly and attentive. Acted like they enjoyed their work." Cons: "Luggage still in Atlanta with Delta." Pros: "The plane was nice" Cons: "I’m still sitting in Minneapolis so I would have liked to be at my destination. And I had to pay for the overnight accommodations." Pros: "Entertainment was awesome. Although airlines are stingy with snacks, Delta had a good overall selection and very generous." Cons: "Something that cant be changed overnight, however, there should be a little more Aisle space for folks pass through as my shoulder was getting beat up after every passing person and cart."

Food was good." Cons: "Plane was delayed for an hour. Legroom in economy was tight." Pros: "The flight attendant from IAD to MSP called Bernadette was wonderful!"

They stole our money. We were at our flight on time but they wouldn't let us board. They then said we were no shows and cancelled all our remaining flights with no refund. This ended up costing us around $3000. We don't have this kind of money and I don't know how we will pay rent next month." Pros: "Flight time and layover at connecting flight" Cons: "Food needs to improved. In all other flight Indian spice is served as Asian veg flight seat are too tight" Cons: "Turkish Air lot my suitcase. I will never travel with them again" Pros: "The route" Cons: "No one gave me water even if I asked, nobody came to me to ask my problem" Pros: "The food and entertainment were okay." Cons: "The staff was rude. The entertainment consoles didn’t work well." Cons: "They are telling me because I booked with Kayak through PriceLine or vice versa they will not give me any hotel for my 14 hours lay over." Pros: "I liked the food and the staff were very friendly" Pros: "The entertainment was excellent!" Cons: "The comfort level for that long of a flight was very poor. Seats are way too close together. There is no knee room from the seats at the front at all. People operating their video monitor is a disturbing fact for the passengers who sits in front of them."
