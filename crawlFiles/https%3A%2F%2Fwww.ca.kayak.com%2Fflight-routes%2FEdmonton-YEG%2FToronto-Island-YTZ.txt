Cons: "Canceling flights with no notice and rescheduling made me lose a day" Cons: "Especially for USA and Canada travel, allow some luggage, you guys embarrassed my child by charging her luggage fee because she had to bring a device she requires. She felt embarrassed." Pros: "The crew is really good. Super nice and attentive." Cons: "Honestly, while the flight delay was a hassle. Probably nothing because flight delays happen. My bag was placed on the next flight. But your crew’s attitude made it all better." Cons: "Flight was delayed. It happens, I know. First time using this airline, ended up landing 1.5 hour later than planned. The boarding process in Toronto was bizantyne, with some discrepancy in the checks and balance forcing a manual check in of all passengers. Amateurish." Pros: "Crew was very attentive and pleasant." Cons: "Stop charging for carry on baggage for outside of Canada flights." Pros: "The crew was very nice, and I love the complimentary craft beer!" Cons: "The agent spents too much time attempting to rearrange the line up rather than help guests check-in, causing a backlog. When issues were brought to them, they seemed disinterested in solving the problem - water was spilled in line and when brought to the agents attention she seemed annoyed." Cons: "Plane had to return due to bad weather at destination. 90 minute delay." Pros: "Hassle free" Cons: "Since it's a small bombardier the leg space is pretty restricted.. only adjustable for short flights" Not having to pay for seats for 53 minute flight when continuing on the Calgary United didn't charge for seats to Chicago or the fort Lauderdale Good boarding and flight (on time!). Loved the entertainment. Had a very pleasant flight attendant and a second one that was a grump. I was told at customs in Toronto that us border was closed at 8:30 on a Saturday, preventing me from catching connecting flight from Toronto to Chicago. Not sure why they close that early, but why was Air Canada having a flight at 8:55 if they knew customs closes before that. The flight attendant assured me I had plenty of time at 8pm to make my flight. Also pearson international is sooo poorly organized and run. They kept saying someone from air Canada will be downstairs or at the end of the hall to help you with your connecting flight. But they weren’t there or had no idea how to help. Complete incompetence. Worst airport I’ve gone through. Poor signage and directions. Plane from Toronto to Minneapolis was small non working rear bathroom crowded plane Look this rating had nothing to do with the staffing on personal level they interacted professionally and with a friendly demeanor. However they canceled my first flight with short notice . Went from 7 hour trip to 13 hours . Then the boarding lady insisted that I check my carry on because it was a very small plane , I did check it , they lost it. Now with a carry on one puts all his stuff in , meds, expensive waterfowl calls and stika gear I hope when they find it all my stuff is there. Kayak you need to ask about entire experience not just the flight. Flight was late. Short flight. Pleasant enough except for being late for unknown reasons, no explanation. Pros: "Service was outstanding!" Cons: "The lunch was average at best. Comedy show selections were terrible (in my opinion). I miss the days of Curb Your Enthusiasm and Arrested Development." Cons: "Took an hour to de-ice. The snow was forecasted. I understand it's the airport operations, not airline, but there should be a better way." Pros: "Pretty smooth flight overall. That being said, I don’t mean nd turbulence, the air pockets really get to me. Great service though" Pros: "Crew was friendly" Cons: "Air Canada was a disaster on our vacation. Delays, re bookings, cancellations. Every thing was told to us as an excuse from the weather, flight attendant was running late, not staffed enough, need supplies on the plane, someone died, planes needing de-icing, planes too small, planes overbooked... you name it they said it! New York to Toronto, Toronto to Edmonton and return. Not one single flight was on time! We got put in a Hotel - only nice part of the trip - got Vouchers for $15 each - such a low amount!!! Didn't get our luggage with our clothes and amenities to use at the hotel - had to sleep in our plane clothes. Spend extra money we didn't have... it was awful! We will be staying away from Air Canada for awhile!" Porter Airlines7.7 Air Canada7.1 Book cheap flights from Edmonton to Toronto Recent one-way flight deals Only flying one-way?
