The highest number of flights to India have Indira Gandhi International Airport (DEL) as the arrival airport. Located in the capital of India, Delhi (DEL) is a convenient place to land if you want to connect to various cities in India. The airport also serves as the hub for Air India, IndiGo, and Go Fast. Apart from DEL, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, also known as Mumbai Airport (BOM), also serves as the hub for Air India, Go Fast, and IndiGo, among other airlines. Compared to DEL, the advantage of landing at BOM is that you will enjoy shorter queues at the baggage claim area and most of the security checkpoints. With the exception of Air Canada, which flies nonstop, all the other airlines offering flights to India make two or three stops before arriving at either BOM or DEL. Depending on the airline you book, some of the layover airports for flights to India are Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA), Istanbul Airport (IST), and Hamad International Airport (DOH). Travellers should be aware that India's monsoon season lasts from June to September and some beach resorts close during these months.

It is recommended that you bring foreign cash and exchange it upon arrival, or withdraw money with your credit or debit card once you arrive. ATMs are available at all major airports and within larger cities. If you would like to visit the "Golden Triangle", consider flying into Delhi Airport, India's largest airport.

Cons: "There was no soap in the toilets on the stretch from Sydney to Dubai. The film choice also seemed poor." Cons: "Just because I have bought my ticket on points I was not given a chauffeur driver." Cons: "Too many security checks at the airport. multiple times opening bags even after through security and scanning. Meal times were at weird times. Dinner at 5am??" Cons: "More meals during the flight would have helped. Also the snacks had limited variety(most of them chocolate) and not enough fruit available." Pros: "The flight was on time and the crew was nice." Cons: "The entertainment options and food were outdated and very much unpleasant." Pros: "Food was not good at all. Crew response is poor for help. I pushed button for help and crew total ignored it. When I asked them when they came to serve food after 40mins, said they were busy to respond for help" Cons: "Emirates didn't allow me to get onto the plane with my 7 lb carry on because of weight issues in the plane. After bargaining few minutes, they were not convinced and only let me get onto the plane with my backpack." Pros: "Everything from take off to service to landing. Was superb, real proffessionals." Pros: "Good flight" Cons: "Crew was not very friendly. Had argument with a old man in the next row over serving glass of water" Pros: "Emirates leg was good. Easy checkin and I think slightly large than usual seats." Cons: "I bought a return from Emirates with the returning flight from Australia to London as a code share with Qantas. Qantas does not honour the e-ticekts from Emirates and will NOT allow you to preselect seats online. You have to hope for a good seat at airport checkin. Too bad, as I would have been prepared to pay extra for a seat upgrade." Found out we were limited to one carry on item per person as we checked in and weight. This requirement has never happened to us before. Then we get on the plane and it's apparent why. There is barely any space on this plane. I sat in the middle row middle seat and shared a single section of leg room with the stranger next to me. Had to put my backpack in the overhead which barely fit and made it so I didn't want to bother getting my things out of it later like my eye mask. There was an angry man complaining about his seat and demanding to be switched for a good 15 to 20 minutes as we were boarding. To the flight attendants' credit, they didn't give into him (not that they could have), but it definitely made for an unpleasant experience. Also there was a child running up and down the aisle during the flight including takeoff and landing. The crew told the parents but they just smiled and continued letting the kid do this. This was p annoying and not to mention dangerous for the kid Pros: "The crew was amazing." Cons: "The customer service from Qatar Airways. No one communicates and it was very frustrating to deal with." Pros: "The crew was excellent. The seat was reasonably comfortable. Boarding process was very orderly and smooth." Pros: "Service is great, planes were on time or only minimal delay. Wifi access, food is pretty descent, blanket and pillow plus small package with toothbrush. Stewardess very friendly and helpful!" Pros: "Very polite and friendly crew. Very helpful." Cons: "Did not have the duty free item I wanted in stock" Pros: "First time flying on Qatar and must say that the crew was excellent. One of the best crews I have ever flown in the last 22 years of New York - India sector. Special mention for HAIFA my hostess for flight QR702 on April 12th. She was the best hostess I have ever had!" Cons: "The food wasn’t bad but since I flew Etihad in July 2017 from New York to Abu Dhabi to Mumbai and back my memories were fresh and Egihad’s food was definitely a notch higher." Pros: "The crew was friendly and helpful. And the food choices were good." Pros: "Gave food vouchers due to extended layover. Marché food quality is average at best." Cons: "Biggest problem was late arrival, missing connection. Lateness caused by them at first, then a departing passenger caused further delay. But they were late to begin with. Next problem was their REFUSAL to give me an aisle seat. I reserved an aisle seat originally, aisle seats were available when I tried to change, but agent REFUSED to accommodate me with either aisle or window. Sat in middle with huge guy next to me. Very uncomfortable. Food was mediocre on this leg. Oh, and late departing AGAIN. Will seriously look for other options on next trip." Pros: "Flight attendants are ok" Cons: "They did not honor my seat reservation they moved me from row 21 to the last row without any good explanation what is the freaking use of buying a tickiet early and reserving ur seat early when they move u anyway" Cons: "The seats were very uncomfortable. Food was less than mediocre." Pros: "Nice crew, seat reclined a lot, great food" Cons: "Bus gate, economy passengers dumping their bags in the overhead bins reserved for business class, really sick passenger coughing their lungs out," Cons: "No body from airline staff was at Lahore Airport to facilitate passengers.Lot of time wasted.One staff member was attending 2 rows of passengers in slow operational speed." Pros: "Crew was excelent ," Cons: "While chk in , they wanted to charge me for half a kilo extra weight , very bad jester, internet charges expensive. Flight was late at departure for 35 minutes without any explanation." Pros: "Connections on Etihad. Abu Dhabi airport. Service and hospitality. On time flights and easy check in. US immigration in Abu Dhabi was a breeze." Cons: "Food was terrible and insufficient." Pros: "Not much. Free shower at the airport was welcome." Cons: "Abu Dhabi airport is poorly designed, crowded and confusing. For some bizarre reason, we had to exit the boarding area (we had arrived very early), and then re-enter at the end of a VERY long line, then dispose of the water we had bought AFTER we had already gone through one set of security checks, to have another bag search inside the boarding area. (???) For a 14 hour flight, you might expect a bit more in the line of amenities (like the Singapore Airlines pamper kit). It’s also nice to know on a long haul what you might be eating (a la Singapore Airlines menu card), but not on Etihad. Also the movies on offer through the entertainment system were a bit stale and dated. They also had no arrivals cards in English, and finding them at Sydney Airport is a nightmare. (Why do we still do the stupid things, anyway?) Then, to top it all off, after a tiring flight, Sydney Airport put on their best demonstration of appalling and confusing crowd control at the baggage carousels and getting through customs. Used to think Etihad was a quality experience, but it doesn’t seem so any more." Pros: "To be honest, the plane, crew, airport... everything was overall pretty nice." Cons: "My checked luggage got delayed for this first trip, and I had to wait three hours at the airport security." Pros: "Staff was great...Food was good...Upgraded to first class !!!!!" Pros: "NOTHING!" Cons: "Abysmal experience on our return flight! # Abu Dhabi Airport is so outdated and an embarassment compared to the other Regional Airports # Boarding procedure still shambolic # A330 seems old and uncomfortable - even though it is a new plane # Cabin Crew so unfriendly and sour # Toilets again disgusting within 30 minutes after taking off # Food still shockingly disgusting # Onboard entertainment still inferior to Emirates/Qatar/etc." Pros: "Lots of food and drinks offered often and tasted pretty decent." Cons: "I was given a baggage tag without any explanations on what that even means. It would have helped knowing I should keep it safe in case my luggage is misplaced or lost by Etihad- which is was! The seats are not that comfortable and I needed to stand a lot. Bathroom kept running out of soap and needed to wait long for staff to replace. Entertainment system was hard to use due to the person in front of me leaning their chair back the whole time so the screen was in my face." Pros: "Seats, Configuration, food and beverage music selection" Cons: "Boarding process as they could not issue our connecting flight ticket lost luggage movie selection limited" I arrived to check in at Budapest airport to discover the My flight had been voided and ended up purchasing a new ticket at Budapest airport 2 hours before my flight for $2,000 US$ Total BS, I called Canada Air for an explanation and was told that this happens because the purchase was suspicious 🤨 really ? It was also explained after the fact that an email was sent to me, this is also incorrect! To add insult to the situation i was told by air Canada that i could have repurchased the same ticket at the airport? Really you tell me this after? Very disappointing Check in and crew very good. Too narrow for leg room. They made us sit on a broken plane for hours. With the AC off. Wound up deplaning after hours of them "working on the aircraft" and waiting in the terminal for an hour more for them to fly another plane in. Fed a series of increasingly flimsy lies to keep us calm and herd us like cattle. Pretty sure at this point they knew the first plane was never going to fly, but they made us sit on it anyways in order to claim a mechanical. The cabin was uncomfortably warm the entire flight. Being scolded as a group, that we the passengers are delaying boarding because of our luggage is ridiculous. Stop charging people to check their luggage and the problem goes away. The flight was delayed five times and then cancelled. Initial communications about what to do were quite unclear. Air Canada lost my luggage and I didn't get it back until more than 24 hours after arrival. Flight was otherwise fine, largely on time and unremarkable. Poor and expensive food selection. Add-on charges for allo but the most crowded seats. Was kinda tight in the seats no leg room. Seats uncomfortable. Maps cpuldnt keep up Allot of ports not working. But was an amazing ezperience. Nothing to complain about short flight. I am glad that it was on time. But it took about 45 minutes to get the checked luggage at YYZ. Cons: "Air Canada is by far the worst airline ever! Lost our connection flight and arrived super late after being relocated in another flight." Flight was canceled. Rebooked on the next day’s flight. Experience at airport to rebook was awful. Entertainment system did not work on rebooked flight. Pros: "The seat was spacious." Cons: "They could have provided a pillow. The entertainment choices was very poor." Cons: "The food can be better. There was no proper message regarding delay." Cons: "Consol provided with my seat 18C on 30th November 18 and 18 d on 6th Feb 19 I.e more than 2 months was no operational . Due to this no entertainment facilities was available during my to and fro journey. Such inefficiency is not tolerable. Pl take note of this." Cons: "it was very cold during the flight. you have to reduce the air condition. the crew was so , so." Pros: "on time, great food!" Cons: "most of the entertainment systems were very slow and headphones not working" Pros: "Overall we had wonderful experience. Good service, food good, good entertainment, courteous staff. I recommend this airline." Cons: "Can't say anything." Cons: "No response in providing wheelchair assistance even though we requested via online/ calling airlines customer service/ Requesting Crew after landing." Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "Flight was 3 hours late. No communication, no response from the crew, no help." Pros: "Good flight.....reached in time." Cons: "Check in luggage in two belts at newark airport creats confusion.."
