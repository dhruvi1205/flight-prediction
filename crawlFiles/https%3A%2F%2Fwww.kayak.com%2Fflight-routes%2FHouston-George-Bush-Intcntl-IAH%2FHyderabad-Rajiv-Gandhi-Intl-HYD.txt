Cons: "they have changed how they serve drinks and food. they used to do that separately. now they club it together." The Crew was Very Nice but the food was Very Disappointing - the seats were Very Uncomfortable Was worse than a low cost carrier. Experience needs to be better for the price paid.

We booked our tickets in August of 2017, Turkish Airlines could've told us this. During booking, they ask for passport expiry date, what's the point if you're not going to tell us in advance and wait till our travel date to tell us this information. We couldn't travel on our vacation as planned and we were charged an additional $3,000 to change our tickets." Pros: "The ground and flight crews were outstanding. Boarding was easy in Houston. I got to see the flight crew handle a medical emergency and saw that they were well prepared, efficient, and concerned. The food and entertainment were fine. I felt like the seat space was better than on British which I often use. I had an empty seat next to me however. I was impressed that the flight crew moved a taller gentleman to a premium (exit) seat to accommodate his extra tall stature. He didn't ask, but they wanted him to be comfortable." Cons: "The airport in Istanbul is pretty manageable. They changed the gate on us twice for the connection, which meant a bit of walking. But the crowd was pretty manageable compared to LHR." The food quality is poor. The staff are very friendly and accommodating. The entertainment program was limited. I experienced a delay of 30 minutes due to two issues.

Cons: "Staff at the airport pushing you to upgrade to first class but not making it clear only the first trip from Athens to Amsterdam which the first class uses same uncomfortable seats as the economy to pay extra 130 euros ridiculous airfrance stuff! I should have flown all the way to NYC first class!!!" Cons: "The flight from Manchester to Amsterdam has been delayed which led insufficient time for me to transfer to HK" Pros: "The bed was comfortable. Entertainment selection and large TV screen was good. The KLM crew is amazing, as usual." Cons: "Food quality was not so good." Cons: "KLM was not prepared to get wheel chair passenger off plane. Cost me delay of 1 hour. I will never fly KLM again." Pros: "Seat comfortable" Cons: "Flight was delayed and overhead bin space was very small" Cons: "The air conditioners fan was bad and they had to fix it in London which took over 40 minutes off travel time...we arrived much later than expected in Lagos" Singapore Airlines8.6 Emirates8.3 Qatar Airways8.2 Turkish Airlines7.9 KLM7.8 Book cheap flights from Houston to Hyderabad Recent one-way flight deals Only flying one-way?
