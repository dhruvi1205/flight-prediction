Crew was friendly and informative. We even left early!Read more about WestJet Everything went smoothly. Crew was friendly and informative. We even left early! We barely arrived in Calgary in time for our connection to Rome. The flight was delayed, and we made it with five minutes to spare. The 787 was amazing. Listening to screaming and crying children for four hours was horrible. Small children should be in one section. Seats were very comfortable and leg room was fantastic. Information was very generic on timing. A lot of people needing bathroom before arrival some didn’t get to use; plane a little small felt cramped but worked still a bigger plane would be nice. Crew was friendly and flight was on time and smooth. No food for vegans 🤔 WestJet at Toronto airport is a mess, flown multiple times and every time there is a 100m line for check in - the machines do not work for 80% of people. Its a shambles. You will be spending at least an hour before your flight in that line. lucky i am considered slender. but i am 5'7", so in case of emergency it would have been completely impossible to put my head on my lap. THERE SIMPLY WAS NO ROOM TO BEND OVER, ALTHOUGH I AM MORE THAN CAPABLE(AS A LIFETIME OF YOGA WILL ATTEST TO). CRAZY DANGEROUS HOW SQUEEZED INTO THE SEATS WE WERE. i have travelled to mexico for almost 20 years, mostly on westjet, but they have obviously squeezed more seats into the 737 to ,,,,,you guessed it make more money!!!!!! also i had to repeatedly move my 'seatmate' as she kept falling asleep, and as she was definately not slender, she squished me into the window seat all through the flight., if i could have jumped out of the plane and swam to mexico i would have done it in a heartbeat. TERRIBLE FLIGHT, NO FOOD, OH, SORRY, FREE PRETZELS OR COOKIES. LOTS OF BOOZE FOR SALE THOUGH!!!! WORST FLIGHT OF MY LIFE!!!!! Too many delays from start to finish of the trip Pros: "NA" Cons: "We paid for transportation to cancun and it didn’t happen. We hope there will be compensation for the lost day. So disappointing." Cons: "We were on tarmac for an hour waiting to take off" Pros: "Crew was great, served us multiple times ! Even tho crew was late 25 mins. We have landed 10 mins early" Can't be happy with a 5 hour delay. Only given $10 voucher for food and still EVERYTHING was an upcharge during the flight. TThe first time I have ever flown with flare and both ways sucked There was no entertainment There was no food or beverage service , not even a glass of water The plane door could not be opened upon arrival I try to buy water the cabin crews told me I had to wait for them to come around with the trolley I waited over 2 hours !!!!! Literally 2 hours I was so thirsty . Lots of leg room in the front rows. Wish water was free. I don't like anything. The crew was so bad. Misbehaved badly. The worst flight. Long wait for baggage check in with only one on site attendant. The worst airlines I have seen in my life they don’t respect anyone they don’t care about anyone they lost our luggage and no one is responding. We waited for five hours to get our luggage back.🤬🤬🤬👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 Great staff. Cramped seating for someone 5 feet, 2 inches and average weight. So if you're tall or heavy -- good luck. Even if you wait until the 24 hour checkin time, you still charge for seating. Really? So either it is a less-than-pleasant experience or pay the price of a "big name" airline. And if I'm going to pay their prices, why would I fly in your cramped seat? So, in the end, you want to give less comfort for the same prices as Air Canada. Go figure. The airplane smokes and they think it's normal.... this is sign of deterioration Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "The flight was late for one hour . We did not have any information why . My driver in Zurich left and I have to pay another cab from Zurich to Kreuzlingen . Nobody from the airline could do anything about ."
