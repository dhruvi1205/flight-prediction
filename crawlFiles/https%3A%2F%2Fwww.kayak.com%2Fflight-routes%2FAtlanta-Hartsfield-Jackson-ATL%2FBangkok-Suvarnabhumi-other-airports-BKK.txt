Poor foods and facilities. Boarding was delayed. A lot of coughing people in the flight even in the business class, which indicated poor screening and health risks. Cons: "Rather long wait at business check-in, friendliness there ok, on board service slow with the champagne, old aircraft with old configuration of seats, nothing really bad, but it's not like this that you win an airline of the year award!" Pros: "The crew was great although I needed to ask them for my meal cause they passed by me. They thought I had my meal already which I didn’t. I don’t think they did it on purpose so it was just misunderstanding. My flight was on SQ 38 from Singapore to LAX on October 30 2019 Other than that. All is amazing. I will still highly recommend Singapore Airlines to other people." Cons: "I think I have nothing in mind about improvements because I can see they have been training very well. I would like to say keep up the good work" Pros: "Crew were helpful and attended to any needs that we requested. As I am a big person the seat is never that comfortable but Singapore Airlines seating is more spacious than other companies I have flown with." Cons: "The food was not too attractive, better variety of main meals" Pros: "Everything. New plane amazing food on a two hour flight Great new entertainment system on the seat back." Cons: "A little more leg room." Pros: "Singapore Airlines delivers as always. Friendly crew and clean and well maintained aircraft." Pros: "Easy red eye flight, just slept the whole way" Cons: "Singapore airline is always awesome. Crew professional and very caring" Pros: "Spacious business class seats, toilets super clean and well stocked. The best eye shades ever encountered." Cons: "Nothing" Pros: "Scoot employees were really helpful, I missed my flight from Singapore to Kochi because by the time the passengers got off the flight and went through immigration in Singapore, the check in counter had closed, and there was no more flights available to Kochi until 2 days later. The employees made sure I boarded my flight and I came home to my sister’s wedding" Cons: "Kayak doesn’t specify its two separate tickets for my destination to kochi from Honolulu, also they didn’t specify their would be a stop in Japan before the flight reached Singapore. The flights were delayed by a few minutes, which led to me stressing to make it on time to my flights, and I felt dehydrated and nauseous. Also the website doesn’t specify that we will have to purchase meals either before hand or on board, and that the airlines only took cash and no credit card. It was miserable, a whole 20+ hour flight with lots of stress of catching my flight, checking and the checking my baggage, and being hungry and thirsty because I didn’t carry enough cash on me." Pros: "Very good service" Cons: "Very poor entertainment. Upgrade options at the transfer desk not very clear and the staff present there not courteous" Pros: "Nothing really, seats were to close to each other and it was a painful flight for 20 hrs" Cons: "Leg-space between seats specifically when the person in front of you reclines" Pros: "The comfort of the plane" Cons: "The staff at Atlanta International Airport were terrible; not customer friendly. The supervisor at the check-in counter needs to be replaced. I am not one of your frequent flyers but travel internationally. However, based on his attitude I will think twice to select Qatar as my choice of airlines." Pros: "Good Service.Efficient" Cons: "No Phone charging facilities on back of the seat unlike other Qatar aircraft." Pros: "Friendly service with smile." Cons: "Weight restrictions for carry on. I had a computer backpack along with a carry on bag which I have always taken with me on other airlines but it was not so here without paying extra charge for it." Pros: "Good service/Crew food quality and choice good." Cons: "Need more choice of British TV Programmes rather than American" Pros: "Gave food vouchers due to extended layover. Marché food quality is average at best." Cons: "Biggest problem was late arrival, missing connection. Lateness caused by them at first, then a departing passenger caused further delay. But they were late to begin with. Next problem was their REFUSAL to give me an aisle seat. I reserved an aisle seat originally, aisle seats were available when I tried to change, but agent REFUSED to accommodate me with either aisle or window. Sat in middle with huge guy next to me. Very uncomfortable. Food was mediocre on this leg. Oh, and late departing AGAIN. Will seriously look for other options on next trip." Pros: "Plane was clean and modern. Staff was very courteous. An overall pleasant flight." Pros: "Superb service. Excellent quality of food. Flexible dining time. World’s best business class!" Cons: "More shower stalls in the business class lounge." Pros: "On our flight from Atlanta, we loved the service and great recommendations from the flight attendant, Carmen, who made great suggestions for our Malaysia trip." Cons: "The seats were very tight and the food was okay, but the staff was great." Pros: "All around great airline. Comfortable for super long flights and completely accommodating." Pros: "The crew members were to patience with everyone and making sure everyone have a comfortable flight." Cons: "N/A" Cons: "Boarding members kept me for no reason to my Cary on bag" Cons: "The flight was an hour delayed due to technical / gas issues" Pros: "Like that I had access to WiFi whole on the plane." Cons: "Not charging for food or snacks" Pros: "Excellent leg room, friendly staff, smooth plane ride and new upgraded seats" Cons: "Nothing, excellent experience" Pros: "The general experience was mostly the same as usual except for the extremely long delay caused by weather (out of the airline's control)." Cons: "JetBlue staff at ATL never once updated passengers on the delay. The overhead space filled up too quickly during boarding and I was forced to check carry-on without time to secure or gather my effects. JetBlue baggage claim staff at JFK were then purposefully misleading and evasive." Cons: "No room in seat where this is suppose to be room. Arm chair tray tables??? Come on now... its 2019. TV was to small and poor TV quality." Cons: "Nobody speaks english. Announcement also in Portuguese. Very difficult for foreigners. Gate people are awful." Pros: "On plane crews were fine." Cons: "When I missed my connecting flight in MCO to SWF, I felt the airline staff was at best indifferent to trying to get me back to my original destination. Customer service was pathetic." Cons: "Our flight out of Atlanta was delayed twice, and eventually cancelled due to mechanical problems - this caused us to miss our connecting flight from JFK to TLV. We had to rescheduled our flights (slow and convoluted route): Atlanta, Boston, Newark, Tel Aviv. We are presently in Boston." Cons: "Reckless and inconsiderate airline. The only carrier refusing to modify travel due to Covid-19 pandemic" Cons: "Swiss perfect as always, Barcelona ground worker disaster, as always...." Pros: "Crew was great. Phenomenal even." Cons: "Economy seating, so hard to complain, I got what I paid for, but 1-2” more between seats would have kept my knees out of the lady’s back in the seat in front of me..." Cons: "It would have better if the flight wasn’t 5 hours late." Cons: "The seat bottom was very uncomfortable and made my bum sore the rest of the day." Cons: "Guy behind me kept asking for a seat upgrade and when they didn’t oblige spent the whole 11hours kicking the back of my chair in protest. I understand this isn’t the crews’ fault. But maybe the bid upgrade for seats isn’t the best system?" Cons: "This flight often arrives late so it is difficult to get to your hotel" Pros: "Service was fine, on the ground and in the air." Cons: "* Online checkin failed * Sit selection was not honoured * Sit was uncomfortable * Was last to receive luggage after landing, even though they had a "business - priority" sticker on them" Cons: "Crew was excellent Seats very short on leg room and hard cushions" Cons: "They ran out of the dinner with meat option. They offered sandwiches to some people as a snack but not sure why some people got them. The crew is okay not that friendly." Cons: "Staff tried to accommodate my vegetarian requirements but with limited success." Pros: "The prompt service of the staff and comfort of the plane." Cons: "Warm snacks instead of cold pastry." Cons: "Seats recline too much making difficult to get in or out because of the seat in front of you" Pros: "Everything was great" Cons: "More choice of movies, and more choice of translations languages for movies. Because longs hauliers need a lot of entertainment. Thank you very much for asking for our comfort" Pros: "The crew was super nice and informative." Cons: "The food was just ok, but not really expecting a 5 star cuisine." Pros: "Foods" Cons: "Delay and the staff not so friendly (flight attend) Halal food have to provide" Pros: "Nice plane. Seats fairly comfortable. Pleasant crew." Cons: "No boarding organization (board rear seats first), mass chaos. Seafood spaghetti should be eliminated as menu item." Pros: "All well arranged. Friendly and helpful crew. Food apprppriate for the trip. Logistics ok. Balue for money." Cons: "I travelled with my 2 friends but none us were given a seat together. We requested few times and they wouldnt allow." Pros: "I liked that they enforced the rule on boarding by rows as many airlines have given up trying to do that and its a free for all especially with certain groups of people."
