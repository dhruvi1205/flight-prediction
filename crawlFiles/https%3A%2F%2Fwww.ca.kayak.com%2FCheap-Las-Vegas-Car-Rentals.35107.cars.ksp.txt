KAYAK‚Äôs top tips for renting a car in Las Vegas Although the Las Vegas Strip has plenty to offer in terms of entertainment, the areas outside the city center also have plenty to offer in terms of outdoor activities ‚Äì which is why finding cheap car rentals in Las Vegas is so important. For example, taking public transportation to Spring Mountain to do some hiking is a bit tricky, and hiring a taxi can get expensive. However, renting your own small compact car or large SUV and driving to the trailhead is simple, affordable, and only takes about 30 mins or so. Las Vegas has a few specific road conditions to pay attention to. For example, at some intersections, there is a flashing yellow left arrow. This traffic signal means that you are allowed to turn left, but only after allowing pedestrians or traffic to go by. After the flashing yellow, the signal may turn into a solid green or solid yellow light. The solid green light is a standard left turn signal, whereas the solid yellow means that the red light is coming soon. Also, Interstate 15 is known to have quite a few traffic jams and accidents. Mostly, these are caused by unclear road signs, constant road construction, a high amount of tourists, and intoxicated driving. Be sure to pay extra attention when driving I-15. Finding parking for cheap car rentals in Las Vegas can be a bit tricky depending on where you go. If you‚Äôre traveling around the Las Vegas Strip in the evening, then keep an eye out for free parking spots on some streets after 6 pm. If you can‚Äôt find any, then consider going to one of the parking garages. Typically, hotels offer free parking to guests, otherwise, it can range from $1 to $20. To avoid the headache of looking for a spot (especially on packed weekend nights), it‚Äôs advisable to splurge a bit on valet service ‚Äì don‚Äôt forget to tip the valet as well. Having a car available is of key importance if you plan on enjoying all that Las Vegas has to offer, particularly if you are not staying at one of the hotels on the Strip. Public transport is quite limited, so, if you plan on exploring the town, driving is your best option. Planning on renting a vehicle during your time in Las Vegas? If your flight lands at McCarran International Airport, you can reach the McCarran Rent-A-Car Center by hopping onto one of the 24/7 shuttles that ferry passengers from both Terminals 1 and 3 to the rental center. No visit to Las Vegas is complete without a trip to the Strip. However, drivers should be aware that distractions line the Strip and it is quite easy to let your attention stray. Because of this, it is advised that drivers make sure to keep their eyes on the road, especially because the drivers ahead of you may themselves become distracted and drive erratically. Rush hour traffic is no laughing matter in Las Vegas. Congestion can become quite severe during the morning rush (from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.) and in the afternoon from (4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.). On the weekend after 4:00 p.m. there is also a separate tourist rush that fills the streets back up again. For the standard work week traffic, I-15 and US 95 are to be avoided if at all possible, as they are two of the worst hit highways during rush hour. 25% of our users found rental cars in Las Vegas for C$ 52 or less Book your rental car in Las Vegas at least 1 day before your trip in order to get a below-average price Intermediate rental cars in Las Vegas are around 9% cheaper than other car types, on average Las Vegas car rental experiences: the best tips from KAYAK users Insights shared by verified travelers who rented a car in Las Vegas Learn how KAYAK collects reviews and tips from users.

They canceled my reservation 20 minutes before I was boarding my flight to go to Vegas so I had to make a last minute reservation with a different company. They told me they overbooked the weekend I was going and they didn't have a car for me which is not my fault. I will NEVER be recommending them to anybody. 2.0 Poor Nov. 2023They called me 1 hour before my rental time, just to let me know that they didn't have any vehicles available, so I will never rent a vehicle from them. Enterprise is the way to go.. 4.0 Mediocre Nov. 2023upon pick up the poor guy was there all by himself. 1 Guy checking in several people and pulling the cars up. He was very friendly and doing the best he could but was there over a hour just to pick up the car. 8.0 Very good Nov. 2023Was expecting drop of car would be hard but it was smooth and quick 2.0 Poor Nov. 2023In short, this rental ruined my vacation and caused a lot of stress, anxiety and extra personal expanse. Definitely not booking through Kayak or Hertz again. I thought I was booking a car at the Las Vegas airport. When my confirmation arrived, I found out I was renting through a tiny satellite office at a hotel on the other side of Vegas from where I was staying. AND there was a possibility that the ‚Äúmanager‚Äôs choice‚Äù might be an EV. Knowing that I was renting the car specifically to explore wilderness areas outside of Vegas, I was concerned about getting an EV. I called the rental office several days before my pickup to find out what instruction they provided about renting and charging EVs in the area that I was headed and vehicle battery range. I was brusquely told there were charging stations ‚Äúeverywhere‚Äù in Nevada and hung up on. At this point, it would have cost more to rent elsewhere, so I was stuck with the reservation and hoped I wouldn‚Äôt be given an EV. I was. What a fiasco. First, office staff repeatedly called me ‚Äúbabe‚Äù upon my arrival. The only vehicles left were EVs and he suggested that I was ‚Äúlucky‚Äù he wasn‚Äôt going to upcharge me to rent one. I told him I didn‚Äôt want it because of my travel plans. He then questioned my travel plans, but continued to assure me there were charging stations where I was going and the car would only take 30 minutes to fully charge. There were definitely not functional charging stations, so I had to completely rearrange my plans in order to get to one, and ended up spending a miserable night in a hotel I didn‚Äôt want to stay at, simply because it had a charging station‚Ä¶that would take over EIGHT HOURS to charge it from 40% battery to 100% I was also told I had to return the vehicle fully charged. Not only were there no functioning chargers and definitely no fast chargers where I had traveled, after over an hour of driving around the immediate vicinity of the rental office, I was unable to find any either! Not even on the property where the rental office is located! What a fiasco. Get your act together if you‚Äôre going to rent EVs, or offer price incentives to rent EVs. Make sure staff KNOWS where functional, compatible, quick-charging stations are located, and can offer that information in an easy to understand way to renters. Congratulations on being part of the problem when it comes to adoption of EV technology. Gross. 8.0 Very good Nov. 2023Process was easy and efficient start to finish. Windshield washer fluid was almost empty and front window was not cleaned for a long time so it was difficult to see in certain conditions.

When I took the shuttle to the rental center I was told that I was at the wrong location. I then had to take a taxi to pick up my car. Enterprise would not let me drop it off at the airport, so I was really stuck at drop off time because I had no way to get to the airport. I'm not sure where the mix up was, but I probably missed something on kayak's website. 10.0 Wonderful May 2021 Pros:Madison was very helpful and kind.

However, when we got home they told us we damaged the car in 3 places. THIS IS A HORRIBLE LIE!!!! We only went to the hotel, to a wedding reception the next day, back to the hotel, then to a wedding the next day and back to hotel, then the airport. And we always park far away from other vehicles!!! Oh, and the Ford Bronco that we drove only had 38,000 miles on it and it was horribly uncomfortable. Brakes squeaked, and it didn't drive smoothly. And I wouldn't have even mentioned this part but since we were accused of damaging the car... 10.0 Wonderful Nov. 2022The entire experience was so very painless, from the car counter check in, the pickup, and the drop-off. All employees were so very helpful that you can tell that they enjoy their work. This is my third time using Sixt, and at this point - I will not use another service.

They gave me the keys and sent me outside without telling me where the car was. Told me to hit the lock button and find it myself. Went looking for my mini van. There wasn‚Äôt one in the parking lot. Came back inside and the employee pointed towards the corner of the lot where I saw a versa. At this point I realized they‚Äôd given me a versa and never had a mini van available. It had only been offered in an attempt to upsell. The car had scrapes on the bumper. It smelled like cigarette smoke and the windshield was visibility dirty. They also sent an extremely confusing series of charges and invoices after I returned the rental. Ended up having to pay $90 for gas. It also appeared I‚Äôd been charged $400 but they were actually returning the deposit. Got two separate charges for the gas so maybe they charged me twice. I tried calling them multiple times but their automated line say to email. I emailed this morning and haven‚Äôt heard back yet. I will not be renting from this agency again. They were the cheapest but everything about it felt very sketchy and unprofessional. I‚Äôll pay 20% more to avoid dealing with this company again. I was especially nervous about renting a car that came with scratches and a cigarette smoke smell because I didn‚Äôt want to be charged for the prior renter‚Äôs infraction. The bigger agencies would never send a car out like that. 10.0 Wonderful Oct. 2023It was so nice 10.0 Wonderful Sep. 2023Good experience 2.0 Poor Sep. 2023Extra charges & since I had some choice words for them for not giving me some money back after returning my car a day early they said I‚Äôm not getting my $500 dollar deposit back.

At least they didn't charge me, I think. Cons:I didn't like having to find a rental in the middle of the night. They work with these booking agencies and airlines but they don't work when flights are late. The other major rental companies were open. Thankfully Fox car rentals was open, with very reasonable rates, especially since I needed a car on the spot without a reservation because economy failed me. Fox was good. Economy will never get my consideration, let alone my business. 2.0 Poor Feb. 2017 Pros:That I didn't rent the car what didn't you like Cons:Everything that was on the Internet was not with was at the car rental place terrible service Internet wise and car rental wise 5.2 Fair Feb. 2017 Cons:I was charged WAY more than the originally quoted price on the website. The guy at the at the rental desk when I went to pick up hassled me about insurance, and let me believe that when all was finally said and done (an hour later) that the price difference didn't actually end up being much more. In reality it was $230 over the original quote, more than twice what I had planned. He also claimed that he upgraded me to a "luxury four-door vehicle" because it was my birthday, but I never reserved a 2-door compact to begin with. It was all sketchy from the beginning. I had problems adjusting my reservation to make it longer (8 days) once it was booked. It was really difficult to even find a number to call to talk to an actual person. I had problems with email confirmations. I had to take two shuttles to get their Las Vegas rental center (which isn't recognized on GPS, by the way, and goes by the name of Verve). The only nice thing about this was the car -- I liked what I drove, and it was clean -- and the shuttle driver was very nice. Even so, I will never book with Economy again. The hidden costs and extreme difference in quoted price vs. actual price was absolutely infuriating. 2.0 Poor Jan. 2017 Pros:Car was small Car was dirty I had a 7 am flight and there was no shuttle service available before 7 am. So I had to pay for a taxi too. 2.0 Poor Dec. 2016 Pros:Economy Las Vegas rental car was far and a way the worst experiences I have had with a rental agency or any company for that matter. They were embarrassingly slow, rude and incompetent. I have traveled with business for over 20 years and they win the prize. 4.0 Mediocre Dec. 2016 Pros:The shuttle driver to and from the airport was very nice. Cons:Our rental did not come with a license plate. It had a registration card in the front window but that didn't stop the police from pulling us over for not having a license plate. Also the car I booked was through economy renta but was outsourced to verve rental which I have never heard of. They wanted put a hold on my credit card for way more than my actual rental cost which I was not aware of at the time of booking.

Easy, no hidden fees, everything was upfront on the app. The drop off was easy too, Jonny got me to my bus stop after checking in the vehicle, again they were fast and made it super easy.

Hotels are packed together on or not far away from a single four-mile-long boulevard, there‚Äôs a convenient Monorail and tons of rideshares and cabs, and it‚Äôs all just minutes from the city‚Äôs international airport. If you‚Äôre coming to Las Vegas and never intend to leave the Strip, renting a car isn‚Äôt necessary. But if you want to explore some of the surrounding attractions - Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area, Hoover Dam, Valley of Fire - renting a car is a great idea, if you do it right. Andrea Bennett 15 June 2023 If it‚Äôs your first time traveling to Las Vegas, if you look out your airplane window at the Las Vegas Strip, you might be stunned at how small it is - at least in comparison with all the mountains and desert around it. You can drive to the nation‚Äôs first and largest National Recreation Area, Lake Mead, in under an hour. The first National Park Service monument dedicated to Ice Age fossil preservation, Tule Springs, is just 30 minutes north of the resorts. Red Rock and Valley of Fire are both easy drives, too, and more and more people are visiting Las Vegas for outdoor sports. You can get to many of these places on organized tours that will pick you up right at your hotel. But if you want to keep your own schedule, and even see multiple places in a day, you‚Äôll want to rent a car.

The license needs to be valid for the whole period of your rental and can‚Äôt be a digital license. International visitors coming from non-English-speaking countries whose languages are written in the Latin alphabet (like Spanish, German, and Italian) should carry an International Driver‚Äôs Permit along with their license. Travelers whose licenses are printed in a non-Latin-based alphabet must carry an IDP for translation along with their license. But it‚Äôs important to note that car companies won‚Äôt rent to you with only an IDP, since it‚Äôs not a substitute. Types of cars available for rent in Las Vegas There's no better place than Las Vegas to rent an outrageous car. Drive it around the 12-mile loop inside Red Rock to experience the scenery. Just don't break the speed limit. Rental prices have historically been relatively low in Vegas since the market for rentals is huge and competitive. All the major rental companies are here, as well as smaller regional players. Typically, SUVs are popular, so expect to pay a premium, if you can find them. If you want to get behind the wheel of your dream car, Las Vegas is your city. Multiple car rental agencies rent exotic cars like McLarens, Ferraris, and Lamborghinis in town, and you can even rent a Rolls Royce Cullinan (the SUV version of the Phantom). Many will drop off your ride at your hotel; some national agencies rent exotics right from the airport; and some will rent to you for as few as four hours‚Äîjust long enough to impress a date. Where to rent a car in Las Vegas Airport If you‚Äôre budget-minded, choosing where to rent a car in Las Vegas may require a little math. On the one hand, there‚Äôs a huge, dedicated car rental building just a couple of miles from the airport served by free shuttles and it‚Äôs open 24/7. Its rates are often lower than anything you can rent from your hotel. Here‚Äôs the catch: You‚Äôll pay airport-specific fees like a concession recovery fee and customer facility charge, and that‚Äôs on top of the 10% state government surcharge, sales tax for car rentals of over 8%, an additional 2% Clark County rental tax and a flat $4 per day consumer facility charge. You can get out of the state government charge and facility charge by going off-property ‚Äì but your daily rates might be higher. The fees and surcharges in casinos can be even higher, without the competitive airport rates. Driving your Las Vegas rental car out of state Most rental car companies don‚Äôt restrict driving across state lines, and some will impose a one-way fee if you‚Äôre dropping off in another state. Still, check car companies‚Äô policies on rentals. For instance, some companies have territorial restrictions and allow you to take the car only to Arizona, California, and Utah. What to know about car insurance in Las Vegas You should always carry ample insurance, but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you need to buy it from car rental agencies. Rental car companies do provide minimum required liability coverage of $25,000 in bodily injury and $20,000 in property damage coverage. But if you already carry a car insurance policy with collision or comprehensive coverage (which pays to replace or repair your rental car) or higher liability than Nevada‚Äôs minimum, that will cover you in a rental car. You might also already have coverage through the credit card you used to book the car, health insurance, travel insurance, a personal injury policy, home insurance or an umbrella policy. It pays to look at your own coverage before you get to the rental counter. Rental agencies sell collision or loss damage waivers, which can be a good idea if you don‚Äôt have a credit card with rental car coverage, or even if you have it through your car insurance but don‚Äôt want your premium to rise if you‚Äôve caused an accident. Like the majority of states, Nevada is a fault state, which means the at-fault driver picks up the tab. Parking your rental car in Las Vegas Hotel casinos have toyed with charging for parking over the years, adding it and then taking away charges when guests complained. Unlike the good old days when even valet parking was free, most hotels now charge for it ‚Äì some up to $40. Some hotels provide free parking for loyal guests with a player card. In other words, it‚Äôs a mixed bag and charges seem to change on a dime. It‚Äôs best to check with your hotel directly before you arrive. Off the Strip, parking is plentiful and generally free. Fuel and gas stations in Las Vegas Top off your tank strategically Las Vegas car rental agencies aren't unique in charging astronomical fuel prices to those who don't return with a full tank. ÔªøRefuel in a less expensive location that's under 10 miles from the return and keep your receipt. Nevada and all the states near and touching the West Coast have some of the highest fuel prices in the country, and there‚Äôs no remedy for that except renting a fuel-efficient, smaller car. However, as in most tourist-heavy cities, you‚Äôre likely to find the lowest prices away from the resort corridor and in residential neighborhoods. You can save on gas if you‚Äôre a member of big box stores like Costco and Sam‚Äôs Club, which discount their fuel for cardholders. When to get a rental car in Las Vegas The rental car industry, like the hotel industry, uses dynamic rental pricing; in other words, on holidays, during a huge convention or trade show, or other event, prices will almost inevitably skyrocket. So, just like for hotels, you might want to look at the city‚Äôs convention calendar while you‚Äôre planning your trip, especially if your dates are flexible.
