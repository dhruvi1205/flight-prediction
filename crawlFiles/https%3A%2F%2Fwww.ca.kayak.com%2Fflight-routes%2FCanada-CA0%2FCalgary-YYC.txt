Pleasant attendants, timely luggage to carousels.Read more about Air North Service was great from start to finish. Pleasant attendants, timely luggage to carousels. This airline is never a disappointment. Always on time. Short haul from YLW to YYZ , best way to travel. Boarding was fine, and flight was on time. During the flight however, you aren't even offered a drink of water. The carts never leave the galleys. All the attendants said the whole time is take your headphones off and buckle your seatbelt. For the price I wouldn't expect 5 star service, but maybe a drink would have been acceptable Nothing needs to change as it is such a short flight. The employees at the counter when we first arrived were very helpful and kind. The flight attendants were are very pleasant and helpful. I appreciated we departed on time. Pros: "Price was the best over competitors. Many dates available. Staff are friendly and service oriented. Coffee is so good. Food is great. Flight was on time." Cons: "I booked online and then had to rebook - by calling the call centre. Be good to have the ability to change flights online as well. Call centre staff was good - except I assumed she’d book us sitting in the same seats as I had originally chosen (which were available - as I checked online)." Pros: "Service was good, frequent drinks and snacks, nice little deli platter was unexpected and very delicious!" Pros: "You constantly got food and drinks served, a big contrast to the other airlines who don't even serve complimentary food on 5 hour trips. We didn't expect to get food on this 2 hour flight so we had breakfast beforehand. We were pleasantly surprised!" Pros: "Friendly staff. Provided sandwich and cookie during flight." Cons: "Minor item: Didn't provide hav charger in seats but for short flights not a big issue" Pros: "From the coffee and cookies while waiting to board to the freshly baked items given while receiving food service, this is great customer service. Not to mention the competitively priced airfare and not having to pay an extra fee for checked bags, this airline can't be beat. I would definitely fly it again and suggest it to anyone if they're looking to fly in northern Canada." The flight was great. I don’t know that anything could have been different The connecting gate at YYC for YXH could have been closer. We de-planed in D and had to walk to the lower level on the far north end (on the other side of A) I am a small person and I had barely any room to move. The rows of seats are WAY too close together and are very uncomfortable. My partners legs didnt even fit in the space in front of him and he had to splay his legs out into both directions in the other passengers areas. I can't imagine being bigger than we are and trying to fit into those rows. Unacceptable. Everything went smoothly. Crew was friendly and informative. We even left early! person sitting behind me on flight to Calgary was vaping There is not a lot of leg room, I was fine but my husband is tall. It was a short flight so that helped. Pros: "The crew was good." Cons: "Seats where uncomfortable. They didn't have the adjustable padded headrest even though we did coming to Winnipeg. You can no longer change your seat selection 24 hrs before you're flight without a fee. There was also no entertainment coming from Winnipeg even though there was entertainment going to Winnipeg." Cons: "The gate in Calgary took approximately 45 minutes to allow off the plane . We arrived early but by the time we were able to leave the plane , boarding for our next flight had already begun. We had to go through customs and other planes from the US had similar problems. Therefore many were delayed." Pros: "crew" Cons: "i would love to seat beside passenger who doesn’t snore bery loud." Pros: "The stewardess accidentally spilled a little water on me but she was so nice about it and apologetic that she paid for my drink. Good people skills in bad situations make a huge difference." I had checked in online the day before but was instructed to collect our boarding passes when we arrived. I am not completely comfortable using the automated Kiosks and always enjoy the nostalgia of speaking with someone when checking in for a flight. Upon doing so however, we were immediately asked,"did you check in online already?" To which I replied, "yes, but we were asked to retrieve our boarding passes upon arrival." She then said, "that's what those machines over there are for. We really encourage people to use those." That unfortunately sparked a series of shortness and overall poor behavior in my opinion from the woman who checked us in. I understand it was early in the morning but I am always excited to experience flying and that interaction has unfortunately left a bitter taste in my mouth to the point I will forever now hesitate to book with Porter again. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Cheers, JD Everything was fantastic, by far the best airline experience in Canada 🇨🇦! Unlike our porter connection this was great , smooth 2minutes at check in not 90 mins Food wasn’t great but it’s plane food , staff were great Porter, like most airlines, need to improve their baggage policies. In reality, there are no longer 'cheap flights' because passengers pay exorbitant baggage fees. Pros: "Efficient check in. Liked the shuttle bus service from subway to airport." Cons: "As expected this is a commuter flight so very stripped down in terms of amenities. Tight plane seating and those overhead bins just barely accommodate the carry on." Pros: "The crew was good and boarding was super efficient" Cons: "No entertain on the plane. Since when YTZ offered no more complimentary drinks and some snack?" Cons: "The flight was delayed by 2 hours . We missed our appointment and want to be compensated!!!" Pros: "Very convenient, non stops and airport is close to downtown" Cons: "Captain said the 1 hour delay was due to bad weather in Washington DC but there was no bad weather in DC. He should have said the truth. I was in flight 729 from Toronto to Washington Dulles airport on 7/7." Cons: "The 4pm flight not leaving at 10pm. Or at least being informed that the flight was gonna be delayed before 3 pm" Cons: "I was required to pay for my carryon, which I was never informed during my booking." 45 minute delay take off. Entertainment system froze half through the flight. Super Friendly staff! Airport boarding was a bit confusing as they didn’t really make it clear what zones were boarding. The crew was friendly and good and I felt safe and secure in the air. I was not happy to find that my “window” seat had no window, when I had options at the time of check-in and would have selected another had I known. I felt a bit claustrophobic. I was also unhappy to pay $75cdn to check my bag, to then have it go missing for 1hr 20mins, upon arrival. I could have been half way to Oxford, my final destination, in that time. The dinner was good, but the breakfast is quite terrible now. It is two sugary items and only one coffee service in an increasingly small cup. We all know inflation is a big thing right now, but skimping on tea and coffee! No soft drinks provided and staff at boarding was very rude. Moreover, the flight was one hour delayed. A lot off people carry on real big suitcases. I wish the staff start enforcing the size of carry on It was way too cold, I called the flight attendants on the screen, no response… when they passed by I asked them to increase the temperature, they said it takes time to adjust… it took until the end of the flight. No blankets available either.. (so pls don’t freeze us in August). Otherwise, it was all good. Thank you The air condition was so cold, several people complained, crew said, they are adjusting the temperature, nothing changed. It was a painfully cold, with jacket on. Other than that, everything was great . I wish they would clamp down on the people bringing large luggage onboard Liked- positive for staff Dislike- boarding was delayed by 2.75 hrs they canceled my flight so i am EXTREMELY UPSET ......................... they gave me a 100% refund but still ........... i will never order a flight from your failed company ever again ........ Flight delayed by 4 hours but no communication. With passengers until after the posted departure time became apparent the flight was not going to board even close to on time. Flight was sent canceled. The absolute most useless staff I have ever witnessed. Utterly careless - literally could not care less. 100% never using this airline again. Poor communication at the check in counter and boarding gates. Other then the screaming baby the flight was fine, nothing special Check in experience was smooth, and the flight attendants were courteous and friendly. Very positive experience overall, thank you all! Flight arrived late but other than that everything else okay Great price for a new plane. Only offered water which we knew.
