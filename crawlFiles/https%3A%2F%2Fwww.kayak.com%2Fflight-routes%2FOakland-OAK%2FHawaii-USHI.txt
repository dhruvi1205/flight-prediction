Legroom should be standard outside of first /business class."Read more about Delta Cons: "Not enough leg room. Flights are costly enough and it just seems wrong to upcharge passengers for more legroom. Legroom should be standard outside of first /business class." Pros: "The plane was nice, entertainment options were great, pilot was super kind." Pros: "The crew was amazing, the seats were super comfortable, entertainment was great, lots of movies to choose from. Also they handed out a lot of great snacks" Cons: "Delays were unfortunate, but the gate area at LaGuardia was way too crammed, hardly any seats, and poorly organized" Pros: "Horrible storms kept us in the air for at least an hour past our scheduled landing time. And yet we experienced virtually no turbulence. The pilots did an excellent job of keeping us updated, kept things as smooth as possible with the bad weather and we had plenty of movies and games to choose" Cons: "I was charged an extra $100 because my bag was 10lbs overweight. Where is this crazy fee communicated on their website? And why does it have to be so much? I didn't have a way to weigh our bag before we left. I had no idea it was so heavy - ridiculous price." Pros: "Even though they were just serving water and coffee. The attendant took it upon himself to retrieve the Ginger Ale i requested!" Cons: "The seats are tight. but hey its an airplane, what can i expect!" Cons: "Boarding was like a cattle call....my headrest was broken so couldn’t sleep upright but face down....seemed like a plane that large would have more bathrooms" Cons: "Too early for me to get up on New Year’s Day" Pros: "Liked the food, the crew were cheerful and helpful. Service was great." Cons: "KLM staff at the AMS airport were not helpful. She insisted that our luggage weigh exactly 23kg. At 23.7, she had us go back to take things out with only 45 minutes to boarding. She was rude and unprofessional. Taking off and landing was a little rough. Entertainment on the plane was limited and a little outdated." Pros: "I do not fly and took my first flight in eight years on aDelta flight. They are partners with KLM. We were late leaving SFO due to traffic..no fault of there’s. I just missed my connecting flight and they have booked me to leave a day later. I was also given a room at Marriott. I appreciate their service and the entire crew from check in to landing. I am now a fan of Delta as well as KLM." Pros: "Yes an amazing crew, comfortable seats." Cons: "Boarding experience is inconsistent board zone 1, 2 and then, all aboard. Out of 4 zones no method to the madness." Cons: "I paid $50 for carry on bag! Too expensive! Same as ticket also front desk workers unfriendly just want to take customers money for luggage" Cons: "The short tray tables didn't allow me to put my laptop on them." Cons: "Felt like I was sitting on a hard metal bench with seatbelts. Oh and having to spend $50 for a second carry-on is ridiculous as is the $18 to pick a seat." Pros: "Easy to board. Comfortable enough seats. Good email communication regarding flight times." Cons: "No free water or soda? Really? On a 3 hour flight they should offer one free drink." Pros: "price of flight" Cons: "over 2 hour delay in departure time; uncomfortable seats. tiny tray table, charge for water" Pros: "I didn't pay the lowest amount on this lowest of budget airlines (still upset I couldn't change my fair when I saw a flash sale a week after purchase). Comfortable because I paid to upgrade seats so no one [else] would be tortured physically by my toddler!" Cons: "Surly flight attendant should get another job, she was short with every passenger. All food AND drinks are sold on flight, no complimentary ANYTHING, which is not convenient given long flights and airport security but we got what we paid for which is a ride to our destination...oh yeah, 45 minute delay due to missing paperwork :,(, time made up in air but we sat for 45 minutes. Knowing the real delay time would have been nice so I could return to terminal to get food." Pros: "Price" Cons: "With Spirit airlines, I paid $57 for a carry on bag... They even charged for water... $18 to pick your seat or let them randomly pick your seat. Theres was I see now why the ticket, was cheap, because you pay for EVERYTHING else... And I do mean EVERYTHING! I normally fly with United, but I found this cheap ticket and got baited in. NEVER AGAIN!!!! Ill pay the extra money for comfort on a 5 hr flight. NEVER AGAIN SPIRIT!!!" Cons: "Our connection flight was cancelled. Our flight from oak was4 hours late leaving. Our seats did not go back. We missed my best friends wedding, despite arranging a trip that will be there six hours in advance." Cons: "I was bounced from the out-going flight and the return flight was delayed twice...once a scheduled one hour delay, then that one was 45 minutes late."
