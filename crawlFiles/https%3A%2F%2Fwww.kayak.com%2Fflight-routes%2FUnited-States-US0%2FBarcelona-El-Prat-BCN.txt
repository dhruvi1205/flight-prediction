Pros: "Entertainment" Cons: "I requested a vegan vegetarian meal and did not get it. I had to do with the regular meal which had a lot of dairy products to which I am allergic to. The space between rows of seats. It was really crammed in Economy and we are a petite thin family!" Cons: "Nada, I slept through this leg and the staff let me be." Pros: "The crew was very nice." Cons: "The seats had such little cushion that it made the flight extremely uncomfortable." Pros: "The airline is top notch and treated you great like it should be." Cons: "The sears where a little tight but not bad and the movie options were ok not great." Pros: "Amazing - they had a full dinner for a 9:55pm flight, with real silverware, complementary alcohol, for economy passengers! Crew extremely professional and efficient." Cons: "We were packed like sardines! My flight made me want to retire from traveling!" Pros: "The crew was really great and helpful" Cons: "Only thing that could have been better was ginger ale." Cons: "The plane was SO hot and stuffy. It was an overnight flight, so they passed out blankets—but it was so hot no one used them. The air was stale, to the point of feeling claustrophobic." Pros: "Crew was fantastic" Cons: "Boarding was delayed by 30 minutes. May have been beyond the crew control." Very good airline. There is still some room for improvement but overall I’m happy If I could fly Virgin Atlantic airlines to every place, I need to go, I would. Leaving Heathrow through the special virgin air entrance, security is completely white glove service. I love this airline. From ticketing agents to flight staff everyone tries to make it a wonderful & happy flight experience. I wish other airlines copied the positive culture of Virgin Airlines. On arrival to JFK it to 3.5hrs to clear immigration, as only 3 booths open. Almost missed connection I booked a virgin flight because I like the hospitality of the virgin crew premium economy is fantastic but I was put on a delta flight witch is nothing like a virgin flight Pros: "This is the way to fly long haul." Cons: "Frustration is it is impossible to sleep during the breakfast service, but this is a problem for all airlines and Virgin is better than most." Cons: "The service on Virgin Australia is quite poor. They are barely around. The seats are also only mediocre" Pros: "Crew was great !!!" Cons: "Seating in upper class is uncomfortable and bedding is not fresh." Cons: "Very cramped aisle seat and I kept being knocked by passing crewe including knocking over a cup of water." Cons: "We are a little hard of hearing. It was hard to hear the attendant when giving directions over the intercom. The speech was garbled and directions spoken too fast. I am not referring to the safety speech. Recommend slowing down so that we have more time to process what was spoken." Pros: "Very friendly crew. We boarded about an hour before so we were ready to go well before time." Cons: "The economy seats are not that comfortable and the screen for entertainment is sometimes difficult to use." I wouldn't say I liked being forced to check my small roller bag at the gate; too many people had bags and were in a higher boarding group. Delta airlines charge $ 30,oo US DOLLARS for the check in for a suitcase in the baggage hold Pros: "Kosher snacks! Thank you. Screens and outlets at every seat. Safe, controlled Covid protocols including de-boarding. Excellent!" Pros: "Delta flight took extra precaution to keep all passengers safe before during and after the flight. They communicate effectively during the flight. I will be flying Delta again and again." Cons: "The trip was great" Cons: "We arrived around 39 minutes early and the whole process was very smooth" Pros: "The crew was great. The pilots too." Cons: "The audio and video at my seat did not work correctly." Pros: "We were traveling international in Twitter after contacting we were told we can carry one checked baggage but then we were not allowed and at gate they didn’t know the procedure and repeatedly We did not get our special meal we had requested" Cons: "We were traveling international in Twitter after contacting we were told we can carry one checked baggage but then we were not allowed and at gate they didn’t know the procedure and repeatedly We did not get our special meal we had requested" Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "We were traveling international in Twitter after contacting we were told we can carry one checked baggage but then we were not allowed and at gate they didn’t know the procedure and repeatedly checked our passport Poor customer service" Pros: "The boarding was great and moved very well. The crew super friendly and helpful." Cons: "More information on how to use the complimentary Wifi in the cabin. I had the app and it helped me but it’s not immediately in front of you so the passenger can decide. You guys offer WiFi in packages and most of the other airlines do not." Pros: "Crew was attentive and accommodating." Cons: "Gates switched 3 times and all bags had to be checked because of a small aging plane." Cons: "I think it makes a huge difference when the crew says something comforting before or during turbulence instead of just “buckle seat belts” it’s so simple yet goes so far is soothing anxiety but we got “BUCKLE SEAT BELTS” like wow" Pros: "decent comfort on board" Cons: "both flights delayed, some rude crew, and Avianca lost my luggage when I got to Medellin" Pros: "Great crew, organized, smooth flight, the team was awesome with my kids on our red eye, which made for such a better trip." Cons: "No breakfast in the AM. I didn't mind because I wanted the time to sleep anyway, but we got there early" Pros: "The movie selection for children and adults was fine. The peach juice was good too." Cons: "The food was absolutely the most disgusting plane food I’ve had. I mean, airplane meals aren’t ever really that great but this was particularly foul. Also they should really stock the seat pockets with the nausea bags especially with all the turbulence over the Andes." Pros: "The crew was accommodating" Cons: "The seats were uncomfortable and they changed my flight 3 times" Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "Having to leave airport after waiting hours for a repair" Pros: "Great service gave my brother all the attention he needed" Pros: "The plane and it was in time. I could sleep" Pros: "Pretty much on time. Entertainment options were great. Clean enough." Cons: "Food was not very good. Extremely salty. Our family of 4 did not eat much of it." Cons: "A rating of one start is too much for this airline. Avianca caused me to miss my flight in LAX, refused to help me reach my ultimate destination for which I paid them hundreds of dollars to do, nor did they offer to credit my losses for which they were responsible. Customer Service was as useless as the individuals in person that I dealt with. I never made it to my destination because I was forced to return home to San Francisco, unable to see my wife-to-be in Brasil. I will never fly with this airline again." Cons: "everything sucked time bery bad servive starfed on flight nonacolok was sergvedngypu ilt was really disappoinyling includigbymkthrvlounhr aothee airlione" Pros: "Specially food service and also boarding" Cons: "They checked carry on again even you passed from the counter I felt very bad about this" Pros: "Food was tolerable. Good cabin temperature. Good lumbar support and pillow." Cons: "Horrible leg space on the first leg of the journey. Air hostess we'e very inattentive. Asked for a blanket 3 times and still didn't get it. Also they had a poor attitude. Power outlets don't work on multiple seats. Oh and again no leg room. Zilch." Pros: "The little details...slippers, nice meal, foot rests, deep carryon bins." Cons: "Legroom, too tight. Attendants blocking lane unable to reach restroom, entertainment didnt work." Pros: "Lots of entertainment on the plane. Very clean. I like the personal touch of a travel Bag given and large head phones." Pros: "The staff is very accommodating and the meals served on board were good." Cons: "Plane delayed by 3 hours. Missed my other flight to Tirana. Horrible service at the airport to help me out with a hotel. Had to run around for over 3 hours. Never flying Turkish again." Pros: "The service was very nice and courteous" Cons: "The seats don’t match up to the comfort level and privacy of the other airlines" Pros: "Flight time and layover at connecting flight" Cons: "Food needs to improved.
