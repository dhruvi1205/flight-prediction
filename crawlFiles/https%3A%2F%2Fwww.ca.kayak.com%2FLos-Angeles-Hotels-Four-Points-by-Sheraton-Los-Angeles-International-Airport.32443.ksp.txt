Outdated, sloppy repairs, gross carpet, and the bar tender apparently added an extra $10 to his tip. Ordered 2 drinks at bar, charged to room. Was like $23, tipped $4, charged $37. Location is the only thing. Stay at the sonesta instead. S 8.0 Very good Sangodare, Aug. 2023 The airport location is excellent. M 4.5 Mediocre Michael, Nov. 2019 Cons:Bathroom super small, heat super noisy L 4.0 Mediocre Liming, Jun. 2019 Pros:Nothing Cons:Everything A 8.5 Very good Anonymous, Apr. 2019 Cons:Room decor is a bit old A 8.0 Very good ANH, Mar. 2019 Cons:The desk chair leather is old and brittle. The leather has cracks on the seat as well as the back. The chair should be replaced or at least have the leather replaced. G 3.7 Poor George, Feb. 2019 Pros:Near the airport Cons:1st room was a dirty and the broken windows . The 2nd room was ok but the bathroom door wouldn’t lock. Plus $32 for self parking. A 8.2 Very good Anonymous, Aug. 2018 Cons:When booking thru a 3 party site you have to wait enormous mouth of time before actual front desk gets the confirmation A 9.1 Wonderful Anonymous, Aug. 2018 Pros:pool was htd., tho 1-2' lower than I like for my daily swim of an hour. Cons:lack of a spa. sticky door due to too much repainting w/out removing old paint. the provided internet is only acceptable for text only. I believe there is no gym no mini-fridge S 4.5 Mediocre Shawn, Jun. 2018 Cons:We had two rooms, both had been recently shampooed and the carpets were still wet and the room had a very strong chemical scent. When I first went to book rooms on Kayak, the price was $119.00, but ended up being $140 each. I didn't think the staff was very friendly. Only one of the three elevators was working and we had to ask where the stairs were because they weren't marked. Would not go back. Also, the shuttle was so slow picking us up at airport, we talked another shuttle driver into dropping us off at Four Points Location 9750 Airport Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90045 What's nearby Venice Canal Historic District8.4 km Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County11.8 km California Science Center11.9 km Petersen Automotive Museum12.9 km Los Angeles County Museum of Art13.1 km La Brea Tar Pits13.2 km Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery13.3 km The Grove14.1 km STAPLES Center15.2 km Getty Center16.6 km The Broad17.2 km Little Tokyo17.5 km Policies Check-in/Check-out Check in anytime after 4:00 PM, check out anytime before 11:00 AM Cancellation/prepayment Cancellation/prepayment policies vary by room type and provider.
