Top tips for renting a car in Portugal If you plan to park your rental car in Portugal, you will need to look out for the "blue zone" parking. These parking spots are available in most Portuguese towns, and you can obtain a parking disc free of charge from either the police or from local motor club offices. Renting a car in Portugal is ideal if you plan to visit more than one area of the country. If you fancy city driving, rent a compact car and discover Lisbon. Or you could opt for a comfortable saloon model and enjoy the short, 33 km (20 mi) drive out of the capital and to the Atlantic coastline at Cascais, as well as the UNESCO World Heritage-listed town of Sintra. If you want to cross the Portuguese border in your rental car, you will need to put in a request with your car rental company. You will be able to cross over to certain European countries, including France, Germany, Great Britain, and Spain. Fees for taking your car over the border will cost anything starting at 9 € ($10) per day. It is against Portuguese law for children under the age of 12 and shorter than 1.50 m (5 ft) in height to travel in the front passenger seat of a car. Children must sit in rear seats in a suitable child restraint. If a child is younger than three, they may be transported in the front seat in a child car seat if the airbag is deactivated. You will need a car seat even when you are leaving the airport, so rent one for around 6 € ($7) per day from your car rental company. 25% of our users found rental cars in Portugal for C$ 19 or less Book your rental car in Portugal at least 1 day before your trip in order to get a below-average price Off-airport rental car locations in Portugal are around 49% more expensive than airport locations on average Economy rental cars in Portugal are around 20% cheaper than other car types, on average FAQs about renting a car in Portugal How much does it cost to rent a car in Portugal?
