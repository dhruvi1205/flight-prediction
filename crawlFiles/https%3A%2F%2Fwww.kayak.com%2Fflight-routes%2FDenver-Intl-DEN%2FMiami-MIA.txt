Cons: "Having a male flight attendant wearing makeup was off-putting. A gluten free option for snacks would be nice." Pros: "Employees were friendly and helpful" Cons: "Every single flight left extremely late which meant I was running through the airport to catch my connections." Cons: "Too much time to board Seated away from my travel partner" Pros: "I checked my baggage with ease.The whole trip was without any inconvience. My daughter in CO made my reservations both ways thru you. I appreciated the great $fare. We will use you again . Thank You, Merry Christmas!" Pros: "The flight attendants were awesome! Very helpful and attentive.`" Cons: "I was told that I would have internet onboard the flight. I was very much looking forward to that. When time came to connect, all I got was inflight onboard local network. No texting, no watching of football games. I would not complain had I been told up front there was no internet access." Cons: "Gate at Seattle airport was crowded. Not airlines' fault but it was tough to navigate Seattle airport." Pros: "Dexter Alaska agent in Seattle helped get me to Portland then Medford a day late." Cons: "Denver agents seemed not to care at all and said I could not get a hotel voucher in Seattle. Phone agent said I could get a hotel voucher because it was mechanical failure. arrived late late late into Seattle to be told there were no hotels available. I had to be insistant to get agents to make the effort to get me routed. They to me I would have no hotel and then wait until 5 pm the next day to fly to Medford. They gave no food vouchers. I had to pay for a hotel I never slept in in Medford and meals. Seems like Alaska has few flights out of Seattle and Denver and no other partner agreements to help route you. Really horrible bad experience. Not what you expect when you patly $500 plus trip insurance. Pathetic." Pros: "We took off and we landed - nothing broke. What else is needed ?" Cons: "I paid for a window seat and the seat next to it. I ended up with two aisle seats. This meant my grand-daughter and I were not sitting next to each other. NOT ACCEPTABLE" Pros: "Great airline that gets you to where you need to go on time and with comfort." Pros: "Most of the crew was great with the exception of curbside check-in in Denver." Cons: "Curbside needs to stop chasing cash tips and do their jobs. If they focused on that tips would be easy to come by. The curbside attendant that took my bag didn’t even bother to check my id. He asked me my name and asked where my destination was. I told him Cincinnati as a layover then LaGuardia where he said that was wrong. He then proceeded to print a boarding pass that wasn’t mine and load my bag into the conveyor. Not 5 mins go by when I realize what happened I wound up having to go to special services to rectify the situation. Which ultimately consisted of me waiting another hour in LaGuardia to get my bag. Please delta have these curbside handlers actually want to do their job and stop chasing cash tips." Cons: "Nothing, really. Airlines unfortunately can’t make people patient or polite, & I can’t afford a private jet, so I’ll have to settle for an eye roll or twelve." Pros: "Comfort and service was great." Cons: "The severe delays was frustrating and not getting enough information about it." Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "I bought a ticket thinking i bought it through kayak but I actually bought a ticket through a third party in India. Where no one spoke good English. I called the agency to find out if I needed a Visa for my visit to Australia and the told me no. So when I showed up to the airport I didn’t have the right documents and I MISSED MY FLIGHT. Also the wouldn’t just change my flight and charge me the change flight fee. They cancelled my flight entirely and made me buy a whole new ticket!!! Worst flight experience I’ve ever had and this is not my first time flying to Australia or out of country." Pros: "Friendly cabin crew. Early am departure. On board entertainment is a great selection of movies/TV etc. Clean aircraft. Comfortable seating. Great flight."

No issues. No delays. Excellent customer service. What more could you ask for" Cons: "No problems" Cons: "When my flight with American Airlines cancelled, I felt so panicked because I needed to be in Florida on Saturday night. But thankfully, lady who works for American Airlines solved my problem on the phone in couple of minutes easily. After that, when we were boarding to the aircraft, there was a cabin attendant lady. She came to us and ask me and my mother if we can talk English.I answered her with yes we can, but she demands to talk with my mother. And English is not her native language, but it doesn't prove that she doesn't know it. She tried to ask questions to her like, "where were you today?" so we couldn't really understand the reason for her to ask those questions in the first place. So we couldn't really say anything. While we were talking about my mother's English, the all aircraft was watching us, and trying to figure out what was going on. After all, she made us to sit there and wait her to replace us with other passengers. We waited the whole aircraft to be seated, then she took us to another seat with my mother. I can understand that it is her job but I'm not sure, if it had to be that much discomfort. We got pretty upset about it and it affects our flight quality. Plus, while cabin crew serving beverages, they didn't really ask us anything. We needed to call them for our order. To be honest, I would never flight with Delta. It was a disappointment." Pros: "There was little interaction due to Covid precautions, however the crew was friendly upon entrance and exit." Cons: "There was a child in front of me that should have had a mask on but was not enforced well." Pros: "Well considering I lost my wallet on the way to the airport and was unable to check in. I would have to say I didnt like it" Cons: "Couldn’t check in online so I got an awful seat and had to pay more at check in and the agent wouldn’t even consider giving me the online rate when she said the website had been having problems." Cons: "Paying for carry on, will choose another flight next time." Cons: "your personal item size is silly. My daughter had to pay to check a small bag, smaller than a backpack that would also fit under the seat in front of her, because with the wheels it was one inch longer than the compartment that they check sizes in at the desk.. Also you can't check in online ahead of time unless you pay to choose a seat. ." Pros: "Fare good but hated having to pay extra for seat" Cons: "Food and entertainment were non-existent. They used to give away and then sell cheeseburgers that were fabulous, but no longer. T flight was 12:20-3:00 so should have had food option. Also they should board window seats first. I had to disrupt a couple with a baby." Pros: "Lines were quick. No delays or cancellations. Everything was on time." Pros: "I was forced to buy a ticket in order to get my rental car. I wasn’t sure when I was going to be returning to Minneapolis. So I guess I’m not upset with my overall experience with Suncountry I’m upset with the overall experience of the travel industry lately" Cons: "Policies" Pros: "Don’t like all your fee gauging. Will stick with Delta from now on." Pros: "I like the overall service once on board." Cons: "I didn’t like the 40 minute wait in the freezing temperatures. The ticketing counters appeared to be under staffed. Very long lines" Pros: "The crew onboard was fantastic. The food was pretty good as well" Cons: "Seat are extremely uncomfortable they are too small" Pros: "Quiet , comfortable cabin and crew was quick to board everyone" Pros: "Crew on the plant was friendly." Cons: "I think at least some small food should be offer even tho it wasn’t dinner time." Pros: "Good, cheap flight that gets the job done. No issues boarding, seats were fine. Cannot comment on most things as I fell asleep almost immediately." Cons: "Would've been nice to have had an eye mask / blankets on a red eye flight..." Pros: "The entertainment system is pretty cool and complete. There seems to be more room on coach." Cons: "The usb charger for my seat didn't work. The power cord kept falling off." Pros: "Boarding was smooth." Cons: "American needs to recognize that people in Miami are savage animals and don't have manners, which is relevant to getting off the plane. They come running up from the back and clog the aisles instead of letting people off row by row like the rest of the country does." Pros: "Hm...can’t really think of anything remarkably good about this flight." Cons: "The FA making announcements was extremely rude and condescending. Other FA’s were listless and unhelpful, even discourteous to elderly passengers who needed assistance boarding. The seat was uncomfortable, no legroom, the guy ahead of me reclined before we even took off and no one made him put it up" Pros: "Great service and on time flight. Got a good comfortable seat with nice leg room." Pros: "Comfort on board, entertainment system" Cons: "Older plane than on the way to Paris, did not like so much the food (except main course)" Cons: "Tecnical problems dellay no good american arlines i dont recomended" Pros: "Crew and staff were professional." Cons: "3.5 hour mechanical delay with no offer for a meal voucher or complimentary snack or drink when flight finally took off." Pros: "The people were nice and helpful. And the aircraft did not feel cramped. I again did not use the entertainment or anything like that." Pros: "Seats were pretty comfortable" Cons: "In-flight entertainment depended on the Wi-Fi working. It did not work the whole flight." Pros: "Decent Crew! Good in flight beverage service and comfortable seats" Cons: "I wasn't able to check-in from my phone ( United is stuck in 1980's) Forced me to use Ticket Kiosk at Airport. Wouldn't print out a boarding pass and wanted ticketing agent to verify my luggage. I had an empty backpack and a small laptop case, she told me only one piece allowed, seriously?? She made me put my laptop in my backpack and the carrying case as well. The boarding pass didn't assign a seat to me and told me that I have to get another boarding pass at gate.. Simply unacceptable. I am a frequent flyer with Frontier and Spirit pirit, thanks to those Airlines which never treated me bad and gave me hassle like United did. No more United for me ever. WiFi was advertised but never worked inspite of me wanting to pay for it." Pros: "I purchased a ticket for my 18 year old dog $ 125.00 each way to fly with me to Kalispell and back. She is so old that she can not SEE, HEAR, or BARK any longer. I understood she needed to be under the seat for take off and landing but I was told by the ticket agent and flight attendants on my first flight that she could sit on my lap during the flight. Everything was great on the way there. On the returning flight,.... the flight attendant was so RUDE to me. She saw that after we were airborne and at a steady altitude, I brought my dog "Kacey" up into my lap. She immediately raised her voice and stated the dog needed to remain on the ground. I politely explained her condition BUT she refused to listen to anything. I put my poor old dog back under the seat. After approx 20 min I could hear her patting very loud. I lifted her again and asked a different flight attendant for some water. She was very hot on the floor. Or course, the flight attendant saw my little chihuahua drinking the water and said that after she drinks a little more, she must remain under the seat. By now, my husband is getting annoyed. He tried explaining to the flight attendant the medical needs that my dog has " she's on protein shakes" which were approved their security. and how fragile she is. She can't BARK, SEE, or HEAR. Yes, we will be putting her down soon but we took her to Montana for my daughter to say her GOODBYES!! Sorry to say, but that flight attendant has turned me away from UNITED AIR LINES forever. Feel free to call me 352-804-8344. You may send this to UNITED AIRLINES too!! Thanks Karen Hope" Pros: "There was plenty of space on the plane even tho it was completely full" Pros: "The crew were polite and friendly." Cons: "A cookie was the only snack on a more than 3 hour flight." Pros: "Nice employees." Cons: "Mechanical delay in fargo caused me to miss my connecting flight to Eugene by 5 minutes. Got to Denver airport asked the gate guy to call my connecting flight gate to see if they could hold the door for me, he said you got 10 mins go. I ran 30 gates and the door just closed and missed my flight. I am 25 weeks preg so my running time is slower then normal. Then they rebooked me on a flight that had an additional connect and arrived 4 hours later then expected. By the time I got to my new flight gate- it was delayed so would miss my next connecting flight.
