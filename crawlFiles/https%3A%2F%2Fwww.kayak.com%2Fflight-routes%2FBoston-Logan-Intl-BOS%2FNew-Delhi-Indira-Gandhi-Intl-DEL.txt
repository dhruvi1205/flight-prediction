It includes lounge access, and other than not having lay flat seats, felt better than some business cabins I’ve been on. Pros: "Just excellent. Excellent crew, excellent food, excellent aircraft, and excellent leg room. No recommendations." Cons: "The flight was fantastic. It was a long flight but the flight attendants took excellent care to keep us comfortable." Cons: "Very good airline except for the fact that the staff at Narita airport." Pros: "I have flied to and from Japan many times with many different airlines. This flight was my favorite." Pros: "FA service with a smile. All pleasant and nice to deal with. Windows are button controlled." Cons: "Economy meal is not that great. Boarding should be by zone or by seat number." Pros: "Was spacious due to flight being in the middle of the week and tasty food." Cons: "Wish there were food. Was hungry after long flight." Pros: "Very clean and modern aircraft. Staff were friendly and attentive. They provided directions and a guide for travelers transitioning from domestic to international flights. Strongly recommend Japan Airlines." Cons: "Nothing, well done." Pros: "The staff helping to check in was amazing. There was an error which checking in at LAX, we didn’t have our seats assigned. Ali was able to get us seats together, and by a window at that! She was incredible and super helpful. I knew it would be a great flight just from her service at the beginning." Cons: "I wish there was a paper that showed you options for food/drinks. The language barrier was a bit difficult at times but the crew was incredibly patience and made sure we got what we asked for." Pros: "From check in to final destination, customer service to amenities, Japan Airlines exceeded my expectations in every regard." Cons: "The flights were everything I expected and more." Pros: "Food is amazing, planes are good." Cons: "The boarding crew at the gate did not say anything while weighing the carry on bag. I was ask to go to another person who issued me check in baggage sticker and told me to hand over your baggage to a person inside. At last he mentioned to not put any valuables in that bag. My carry on bag was just 1lb extra and the first person could have told me right away and I would have thrown away chocolates and brought down the weight to permissible limit. In general passenger do carry valuable stuff in carry on bag. I had to follow whatever I was told." Cons: "I am an Emirates skywards member and I was placed in the middle seat when my preference on Emirates and Kayak is an aisle seat. After boarding it was explained to me that I couldn’t move to an aisle seat even though more than one seat was available. I asked to pay or to use miles I have accrued." Pros: "Overall good experience, could have been better if we had got seats of our choice." Cons: "If we could have got seats of our choice." Pros: "For an economy seat, was very comfortable!! Love the food." Pros: "Overall a decent flight." Cons: "Didn’t like the boarding experience. You have somebody look at the boarding pass but then they sent us to a waiting area. The waiting/boarding area didn’t have space to make nice lines fir boarding so it was pretty haphazardly organized. You really can do better." Pros: "Cleaningness" Cons: "Main problems at Dubai airport. Employee at the airport charged me money for the same luggage that Newark employees said it is according to air line rules. That shocked me. I didn’t buy anything from Dubai. I think it’s not right." Pros: "Staff helpful and courteous under difficult conditions." Cons: "People were allowed wheel chairs without a doctor'snote. 59 wheel chairs passengers is ridiculous. Make it a requirement wheel chair assistance required a doctor's note. And check hand luggage weight. Many bags excceeded the limit." Cons: "The airline’s insistence on keeping a passenger limited to only one carry on bag and then weighing to make sure that each carry on item was only 7 kilos was just plain ridiculous." Cons: "Both the flights were delayed. No accommodation was offered. With two little kids we planned and even payed more to travel with this airline. Overall, experience was big disappointment. Our expectations were much higher than what we experienced." Pros: "I recently booked a flight on Qatar first, to Ko Samui, Thailand. When I got on the plane, I asked the flight attendant to please be careful when he pushed the cart down the aisle because the last time I flew, the flight attendant smashed the cart into my elbow and drew blood. The flight attendant laughed at me, so I told him, calmly, that if it happened again, I would sue the airline. He didn't like that, and so for the next ten minutes he sent three different flight attendants over to ask me crazy questions like, "Do you have anything you would like to tell us?" I have no idea what this was about. Eventually, I was told to get off the plane, which ended up costing me over $1,500 in transportation, hotel, and new flight (on Emirates) fees. It was and still is a nightmare because my vacation has been ruined due to having no money. I'm a master's-degree-holding English teacher of 11 years with no history of ever having been asked to get off of a plane for any reason, and no, I was not drunk because while waiting for my luggage to be returned, had a conversation with three Boston airport police officers who did not arrest me or even understand why I had been kicked off of my flight. Nor did I speak a single profane word to the Qatar flight attendants or security, and of course, I did not use violence or resist when I was told to get off the plane. Unlike Qatar's staff, the Boston police officers were very polite and understanding. Emirates, on the other hand, was a completely different story. They were great. The staff was friendly, and when I was sleeping, they didn't send their staff over to harass me. I have flown on Emirates, Qatar, and Ethihad many times, and I truly don't understand why Qatar's staff have been instructed by their managers that it is okay to lose long-time customers and kick professional teachers off of their planes just because they think I wasn't perfectly sweet and nice to them all the time. I am an American, and in my country we have freedom of expression and speech, as long as that speech does not indicate violent intentions or use profanity or insults. Basically, I felt as though I was in a country with no rights to free speech at all. Presently I am having my lawyer work up legal documents for Qatar to get my money back and to reimburse me for travel and hotel expenses, as well as having to take two extra days off of work to reschedule my flight. I truly believe in the transparency of the travel industry through using comments like those I am making you readers aware of right now, and I assume you will benefit from this rhetorical question/advice: Emirates and Ethihad are sometimes a little more expensive than Qatar on certain flights, but is it really worth it to risk having Qatar take your money and make you miss your flight for no reason? Is it acceptable for an airline operating in the USA to deprive Americans of their right to express concern to the flight attendants on their plane?" Pros: "In-flight entertainment choices." Cons: "It was a long flight, frequent offers of snacks and drinks would’ve been great." Cons: "The lounge, they use the club lounge in Boston which was so so. Could we have use the one world BA lounge instead?" Pros: "Everything" Cons: "It could be better if they serve food from Doha to Islamabad." Cons: "Qatar airways claims to have inflight wifi. But it is not true because it did not work in either of my flights. Food could have been better." Cons: "the area I sat in smelled weird even though the crew helped spray a solution it didn’t help the smell .. Vegetarian meal is not good" Pros: "Our flight attendants were all amazing, but especially Joanna!! She was outstanding and went above and beyond to assist us in every way possible!!" Pros: "In my departure flight, there were many empty seats and the crew let us move to another seat to lay down and sleep. Also the food was very good and there was a great selection of movies." Pros: "Excellent customer service, from the check in process, to boarding, to flying 21 hours from Boston to Phuket with infant- we couldn’t have asked for a better experience! Everyone was so accommodating and helpful as we traveled with our 7 month old a lot g distance." Cons: "I had been told my checkin bags will be available at final destination but I had to pick them up at Delhi and do the checking in once more which was a lot of hassle with kids" Pros: "inflight and qatar airport crews were accomodating eventhough there were backlogs due to delays caused by snow storm." Cons: "The Ground crews in boston airport were not accomodating." Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "Entertainment didn’t work, the crew did nothing to help. The plane was hot and stuffy. My luggage is lost." Pros: "The crew service was very good, as was the food. The only complain is about the entertainment, hope to update the touch screen." Pros: "Everyone was friendly, pleasant and very helpful. Upon arrival in Delhi our suitcase handle was broken." Cons: "I asked the Chinese flight attendant in economy to please ask the man in front of me to put his seat up since the captain and purser had already asked us to do so in three languages The man in front of me refused to do so. She said she was going to start at the front of the plane and let him leave his seat back making it difficult to see my tv monitor. I thought that she should’ve said that it was time to put your seat up. It was frustrating that she didn’t support me and the request of the captain. Your seats are very uncomfortable upright when the person in front of you has their seat back." Pros: "On time; smooth boarding process; lights dimmed for a reasonably long time." Cons: "NO legroom on the Zurich to Dusseldorf flight." Pros: "On time arrival" Cons: "Boston -Zurich, the most uncomfortable seat possible. I am 5’2 and I barely fit.... Seats are way more comfortable on European flights." Cons: "The temperature on this overnight flight was sweltering Legroom was poor" Pros: "We were pleasantly surprised at how good the food was! An added bonus was the chocolate they gave us. Crew was professional and courteous." Pros: "The staff upgraded me to business. It was a great wxperience" Pros: "There were good entertainment options though I didn’t use them" Cons: "Our flight was delayed 2.5 hours, during which we had boarded but were told we could not leave our seats even for the bathroom. We were offered a cup of water once during this delay which is inexcusable. (We were also woken up to serve dinner at 1am so that was incredibly inconvenient for an overnight flight) On top of that, I, as well as many others missed our connecting flight. Personally I missed my connection by 20 minutes, which seems a reasonable amount of time to hold a connecting flight with so many people from our flight on that next one. In missing by only 20 minutes, we have lost an entire day of our trip and are spending 9! hours in the airport today. There was no communication between flights clearly. Despite there being an earlier flight we could’ve been placed on after missing our connection - we did not get booked on this flight. I asked why and they just randomly placed people on random flights with no regard for when we showed at the desk. In this scenario, a first come first serve would have alleviated an absolutely awful experience. I will never fly Swiss Air again and will urge people I know to not fly this airline. The experience was extremely frustrating, the best response from an employee was “that’s all I can do for you” and I wish it on no one." Pros: "The plane was new and had a great feel. Pilots and crew very professional." Pros: "Hardware was excellent. One of the most comfortable First Class seats for sure." Cons: "CX first class is designed more for individual travelers so for couples who want to sit beside one another there will be an aisle in between them. The Boston BA lounge is horrific and depressing so it should be avoided." Pros: "The crew was great. They were very quick to respond to any requests and were very accommodating." Pros: "Entertainment" Cons: "The accommodation/attendance from the flight crews. They looked like they have just been deployed from training." Pros: "Crew was helpful but 1 crew forgot my dinner drink which was a hot tea drink." Cons: "Maybe write down who ordered drinks while serving dinner tray.. if there were turbulence the crew can go back to that list then setve it when seat belt sign is off." Pros: "miracle fight landed on time" Cons: "terrible food - poor entertaiment system with limited choice and old movies - crew always on the pa" Pros: "Everything, thank you. See you next time. The best airplane" Pros: "The crew was excellent...very flexible with meal service and appropriate presence during the long 14 hour flight." Cons: "Quality of movie options not very good." Pros: "As per usual, Cathay’s service was top notch. Friendly, courteous crew, good food, a great entertainment system with a great selection.
