She went down the isle and was letting children pet it. I felt this lwas dangerous, as you never know what a child or dog are going to do. I had a nurse sitting next to me and she said you can’t believe how many children are bit by dogs who have no history. The crew did nothing to stop this" Pros: "Check in was great" Cons: "There was a women on the flight with a dog. She went down the isle and was letting children pet it. I felt this lwas dangerous, as you never know what a child or dog are going to do. I had a nurse sitting next to me and she said you can’t believe how many children are bit by dogs who have no history. The crew did nothing to stop this" Cons: "Minor but thought is share. A party with kids got boarding assignment in A and B sections for a single reservation, and then when A was being boarded, all were told that all have to board with B since at least one in the party was in B. Since with kids, probably ok to pretty everyone as A." Pros: "Plane was late and despite bringing candy canes to Terry to make the crew happy, the crew seemed irritated. Not what I’d expect from Southwest." Cons: "Try to make the customers feel like your at least slightly happy they are there." Pros: "Crew was nice, food we had cookies and inflight beverages." Pros: "Boarding process went very smoothly. Flight was on time when many others at the same airport were not. Capitan keep us informed well. Baggage came up very quickly in Denver." Cons: "Plane comfort was okay but should be better. Need to review newer seats." Pros: "Gate staff was great!" Cons: "10 mins late for "paperwork". Flight crew was late getting to the plane in the first place." Pros: "The seats feel roomy, staff is great." Cons: "Departing an hour late is hard but I know it happens." Pros: "New plane. Much quieter and nicer. Also got aisle seat in emergency row, so had plenty of room." Cons: "I still think the charge of $8 for internet is just too high. Although I enjoyed watching football game, I would rather listen to Apple Music subscription. But I’m not paying $8 for this pleasure for 2 hours. How about reducing the price to $2 or something else that is less." Pros: "The ability to sit next to my person." Cons: "Soccer team of over 20 kids who were allowed to act their age. Also, your pretzel bags are hard to open. Southwest flight attendants were awesome." Pros: "We were slightly delayed because of the weather, but our pilot was able to find a smooth flight plan and arrived with minimal delay." Pros: "Aircraft was clean and comfortable. Crew was efficient and friendly. The whole experience was excellent!" Cons: "There was lots of entertainment available but plain old music was not an option. What if I don't want to watch a movie or TV, just listen to music!" Pros: "Crew was very nice." Cons: "Boarding was very hectic. This caused the plane to be delayed" Pros: "The seat was comfortable and the plane wasn’t over booked." Cons: "I didn’t like that we took off an hour late." Pros: "Attendants treat passengers with respect and a smile. A seasoned crew that worked hard the entire flight." Pros: "The flight attendants were friendly and professional and took time for a little personal conversation." Pros: "Flight was delayed 3 hours. But once it finally got in air flight and service was better than most. Fortunately we have a one day layover so we didn,t miss any connections like others on the flight." Pros: "Management as well as staff nice...First trip with Alaska and made my trip nice .. Got a good deal price too." Cons: "Nothing." Pros: "Plane very warm, not comfortable. Only one pass for beverage service." Cons: "Very warm air vents did not work." Cons: "i wish Alaska would fly straight to Denver from Montana. I fly from Montana to Denver a lot and it ends up being a whole day of travel instead of a couple hour flight." Pros: "The planes were amazing so comfortable like a brand new car .." Cons: "OMG scariest flight I had ever been on .... Windy and terrible weather . It’s like a free Mr Toads Wild Ride .. Thanks for getting us home in one piece !!!" The flight attendants were friendly and seemed to like their jobs. I am not a high maintenance person, but they seemed to respond to people's needs and requests in a timely fashion with a smile.. I appreciate the benefits of complimentary snacks and beverages, as well as the relatively inexpensive checked baggage fee. (Although I would like it better if it were free! :) ) The only improvement that could be made to make the boarding process more efficient is to board the plane from the back. The alternative would be to board people with only a personal item first. This would reduce the wait time while others are stowing their baggage. Pros: "My favorite airline to travel from Denver to Puerto Rico, round trip, and in Atlanta I will make the stopover, I also feel so safer to travel with my cat ... they are the best airline in everything" Cons: "Let people who travel with pets earn extra points for taking them with Delta" Pros: "On a quick 40 minute flight they still managed to serve coffee, water and snacks." Cons: "Seats are terrible - need replacing-worn out; say like Queen Latina, setting on top of one another; absolutely no leg room!" Pros: "We actually did not fly this route. We bought a car and drove home!" Cons: "Better screens for in-flight movies. More legroom or upgrade options." Pros: "Got me there Safely" Cons: "Couldn’t understand announcements... at all! By flight attendant or pilot" Cons: "There was no food or entertainment. There was a problem with the seat of the person in front of me. He couldn't keep his seat straight and his head was in my lap throughout the flight." Pros: "Entertainment choices were excellent, many new movies available, so I was able to see movies is been meaning to watch. There were drinks available." Cons: "The air vents barely trickle out any air anymore. No relief to be had. Airline crews say hi and goodbye but that doesn't make them friendly." Pros: "Great crew" Cons: "Wi-Fi not working or hard to get to work. Flight was delayed by an hour and service was very rushed." Cons: "There are too many announcements on the screen before you can start watching entertainment. It takes about 15 minutes." Pros: "Good entertainment choices." Cons: "Uncomfortable seat with insufficient legroom wouldn't recline. Inadequate overhead storage (full flight)" Pros: "The flight itself was fine." Cons: "The gate change was not announced on my phone app (changed from E7 to D49). I hate leaving out of Terminal E at MIA. There is no point to having TSA Pre-Check if you have to stand in line with people who don't have it. I have to remove my liquids and laptop. It's such a shabby, run-down terminal." Cons: "American Airlies no longer partners with T-Mobile for free WiFi. :-(" Pros: "ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!" Cons: "At 12:40 p.m. we boarded American Airlines flight 1350 in ATL, just to SIT on plane for 1 1/2 hours (half the time with NO AIR). Computer problems. Had to get off plane, then had to wait in 3 lines. Agents were so UNPROFESSIONAL! Kept saying flight would go... DID NOT go until another plane came in at 9:00 PM! We, needless to say missed our connecting flight to SYDNEY and had to wait til next day and fly to SAN FRANCISCO, then to MELBOURNE, then on to Christchurch. We MISSED out on TWO DAYS of our short trip! which included missed reservations!!" Pros: "Pretty standard flight" Cons: "Inconvenient timing and overcrowded with obnoxious children sitting on laps. No attempts made to change their behavior by crew or parents." Pros: "The airplane was modern, clean and comfortable and the flight was on time" Cons: "Everything was good" Pros: "Easy and quick boarding. Excellwnt service in first class. Comfortable ride." Cons: "Nothing. Excellent travel experience." Pros: "On-board staff were professional and kept everything running smoothly and with great communication from the pilot." Cons: "Claiming baggage at LaGuardia was an hours-long process for everyone on the flight leading to raised tension and lots of tired folks on what was already a late (and delayed flight)." Pros: "VEry good Cabin crew and the plane was reasonable new" Pros: "I liked the ticket price." Cons: "The seat was very narrow with absolutely minimal leg space, and a carry-on bag was not included in the fare." Pros: "The ease of boarding the plane." Cons: "I did not like that the gate changed and we were not notified by the gate operators, but we did receive a text message 20 minutes after the gate was changed." Pros: "Almost everything was great!" Cons: "The internet service barely worked and I will be seeking a refund" Cons: "Plane was delayed so I missed the connecting flight to sl... so frustrated" Pros: "Nothing." Cons: "UA supervisor literally said, “It’s not our fault so now hotel assistance and you have to leave airport. When I asked what we should do since all the hotels were booked he said, “You can go anywhere you want to go but you can’t stay here.” Callous, uncaring, worst experience since I was in Desert Storm!" Pros: "It was a bit less expensive at first, but the charges added up quickly. My only complaint really is that the booking was through Air Canada and the flight was operated through United Airlines. It wasn’t a problem for me but if you only have a Visa debit card and want to pay for checked bags online, this is not possible to do online prior to checking in. You also can’t check in to your flight as you would normally, you get the last available seats and have to pay for any seat changes. All in all, I’d still book through Kayak but I’d make sure that the flight I booked was through the company that operates the flights. It’s will give you more options when checking in to the flight." Cons: "I was put through a third party airline that had no control of the final booking procedure that I was used to. I could not choose seats or add checked luggage on my visa debit, I needed a credit card. This wasn’t a problem but it could pose problems for some people." Cons: "United never got us to Atlanta, we spent all day in the airport with delays and no help with seat accommodations on other flights over 4 hours in customer service lines all to be sent back home and gave our luggage lost. Basic economy is such a scam and this was the worst ever flight experience" Pros: "Loved having the ability to watch a movie on my phone using on board entertainment!" Cons: "The fact that I wasn't able to sit with my travel partner" Pros: "Crew was professional and courteous. Smooth flight. We paid an extra $98 per seat for economy plus seats, and it was worth it.
