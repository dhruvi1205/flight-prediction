Lots of entertainment options. Food was good. On time, no complaints. No seperate security check for business class passengers and average lounge, open air, so not properly air conditioned Pros: "Crew was super nice and the food was good (for plane food)! Really appreciated that they had snacks and chocolate on hand for hungry passengers throughout the flight. A 17 hour plane ride is never the best, but Singapore Air made it as pleasant as possible. Also, we booked on Kayak and was routed through a third party vendor JustFly, which I was a little worried about - but our booking went off without a hitch." Pros: "I liked that on the longest leg of my trip - I had an entire row to myself to stretch out. Im old, things like that are important...along with compression socks...haha!" Cons: "I think the food - I dont know exactly what, because we're on a plane - but I think it could be a bit more appealing? More greens, colors? Not sure, but it was okay." Pros: "Excellent crew and very well dressed and always smiling" Cons: "The lights were switched off for a very long time. That can be avoided" Cons: "The seat covers looked worn and dirty. Needs an upgrade." Pros: "crew handled the tough crowd well, but were not extremely hospitable" Cons: "food was disgusting" Cons: "WiFi didn’t work on 3 of the 4 flights although all purportedly had it. Also didn’t work the majority of the time in the Business Class Lounge in Singapore. Food was mediocre both on flights and in the lounge. Movie selection could hardly have been worse." Pros: "The crew did a wonderful job of anticipating needs and having all the little ammenities you could want." Cons: "They gave you a menu at the start of the flight but didn't serve any of that food, and the food wasn't very good" Cons: "Luggages did not arrive with the flight as it should be. It got lost in Sydney from Queenstown on flight SQ 6683 operated by Virgin Australia (VA 162)." Cons: "An airline not only with the best service but the best looking flight attendants. They genuinely smile" Pros: "Emirates is my airline of choice. They do everything well." Pros: "Crew was great" Cons: "The seats were pretty stiff compared to the A380 business class seats on my preceding flight." Cons: "flight left very late. couldnt make up time on the way. had to struggle to make it to the connection." Pros: "Crew was amazing." Cons: "Seats were a little narrow and could use new cushions." Cons: "In most cases i was so disappointed to be allowed only 1 lugage of 50lb while i was supposed to be allowed 2 50lb of bags,i had to pay 275$ for the extra luggage,very disappointed as i was not expect that to happen,you guys made me look ashamed infront of people as i had to borrow money to pay for" Pros: "The crew was great and the dinner was really good!" Cons: "Breakfast could have been better and the seat was pretty uncomfortable" Pros: "Timing of flight" Cons: "Baggage policy has changed and has become too restrictive. Wieight and size and number of checked baggage is below competitors for transatlantic flights. Same for cabin luggage and is enforced randomly. Some economy passers were allowed two pieces, others were forced to check in cabiuggahe at $200." Pros: "Emirates itself was great but using fly Dubai from Dubai to Kabul was awful." Cons: "No flights to Kabul using Fly Dubai when someone books tickets actually for Emirates." Pros: "The crew was fantastic. The food was good for airline food." Cons: "The seats were narrow and seemed a bit smaller than usual." Cons: "The crew at check in was really inconsiderate and has given us false information! Despite of what documents were required and submitted I was not allowed to board the plane." Pros: "Crew was wonderful. Comfortable seat with nice meal. Overall loved it" Pros: "The crew was amazing. Food was great. Clean bathrooms. Great entertainment." Cons: "We had our passports and boarding passes checked five times in the course of 2 minutes by five different people one after the next. My cabin luggage was searched right before boarding. I appreciate the need for security, but that was excessive and unnecessary. In the peak of the Corona virus craze, the security made all passengers take off shoes and walk without any protection. This is not Qatar Airways doing - New York JFK security B S, but I am sure airways companies have some say to change it." Pros: "The check-in crew in Chicago was very nice and efficient. The flight crew on-board were not friendly, they were very curt and rushed, and did not go out of their way to be helpful." Cons: "Friendlier staff during the flight. Better food for breakfast. The connection port for my headphones did not work...I would not have been able to watch movies if I hadn't brought my own single connection head phones."

Very uncomfortable seats" Pros: "The crew provide good service but personally i did not like the food that could be lot better." Cons: "Extraordinarily care taken On board. Very impressed with Qutar Airways. Excellent" Pros: "Nothing. There was no flight. The flight was cancelled and you did not notify us. We found it out ourselves by accident. We tried to contact you guys but we could not call or anything other. You guys suck" Cons: "Notify your customers when the flight is cancelled. Thats the least you can do. Very unprofessional" Cons: "Too much nonsense with carry on and check in language. I paid for my seat but they changed it for better balance of the plain. Really I weigh 165 lbs. Once the plane reaches altitude they let me take my seat. However the plane was barely occupied and somebody with closer and took my seat." Cons: "The sitting was so very small, I never traveled so crumpled." Pros: "I was fortunate the person in front didn’t lean back" Cons: "On Swiss website I added Rehe preference for a lactose free meal — but none were on the plane. The economy seats are close enough together I needed to hold my book to the side to read." Pros: "Good crew, food was good for airline food. Entertainment offerings were good." Cons: "Too many seats, 3-4-3 configuration means not even enough room to walk down aisle without bumping people in their narrow seats." Pros: "Amazing - they had a full dinner for a 9:55pm flight, with real silverware, complementary alcohol, for economy passengers! Crew extremely professional and efficient." Pros: "Crew were great" Cons: "Cabin kept very hot, very difficult to sleep. Seats were so-so comfortable" Pros: "Orderly boarding process. Considerate reseating when bulkhead with extra legroom were not usable." Pros: "The crew was amazingly efficient serving food and drink. In the recline position the seat bottom extended which was far more comfortable than simply reclining." Cons: "The food was mediocre and the selection of movies was very limited." Pros: "Crew was great. Phenomenal even." Cons: "Economy seating, so hard to complain, I got what I paid for, but 1-2” more between seats would have kept my knees out of the lady’s back in the seat in front of me..."

Food and service" Cons: "Unanounced delay of about one hour due to long unexplained route" Pros: "Food and entertainment was great." Cons: "Delayed at origin and layover. Crew was a bit hard to track down at times." Cons: "The booking experience was exceptionally bad. Never again through you." Pros: "Excellent service and food. Good selection of movies. Great overall experience." Cons: "Crying baby and squealing toddler."
