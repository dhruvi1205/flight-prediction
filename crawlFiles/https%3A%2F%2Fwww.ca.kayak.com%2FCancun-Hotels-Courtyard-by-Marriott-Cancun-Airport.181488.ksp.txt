It is clean, the rooms are spacious and the staff is friendly. We use the Courtyard to arrive a day early before our weeklong stay at a nearby resort. We extend our vacation and begin our week well rested. Y 8.0 Very good yadira, Feb. 2022 The shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel bottles were empty. J 10.0 Wonderful Justin, Sep. 2019 Pros:I was really extremely happy with the powerful a/c and blackout curtains. I slept like death for 15 hours. The Wifi was excellent, I needed to take a really important work meeting and had no issues. Would stay there again to play it safe just for the trusty WiFi. P 6.5 Okay Paul, Jul. 2019 Pros:Its ok Cons:Room service terrible A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Nov. 2017 Cons:Airport shuttle was great on way back to airport but their time estimates for pickip were off. They said shuttle would be there in 15 but it took over 30 mins. No biggie but could be improved. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Mar. 2017 Pros:Omar at the front desk saved our vacation by lending us his phone charger and putting us in a room when we arrived with blocked credit cards and a broken phone charger. Their shuttle will get you to and from the airport and to a car rental agency way cheaper than a cab. The eponymous courtyard is beautiful. Nice pool, whirlpool and hot tub. Many of the trees, shrubs and flowers are identified by placards and several species of birds visit or spend the day there. A great place to begin and end your vacation in Playa del Carmen or Tulum if you get in late and/or leave early. A 4.0 Mediocre Anonymous, Sep. 2016 Pros:Dios was good service was ok. Cons:I has to Call front desk three times in the same night,diferente things where broken. Fue shower head was not spraying water the tv channels where hoy programed and fue ac unit did not cool. A 5.1 Fair Anonymous, Jul. 2015 Pros:The staff was nice and it was easy to get to the airport. Cons:Tried two different rooms, both were moldy and the blankets were damp. If you have any respiratory issues or allergies to mold you should probably avoid. Wish we had just stayed in the hotel zone since there were rooms only a bit more and they were on the beach. Probably shouldn't walk barefoot either. The carpets were old and matted down and felt dirty. A 6.2 Okay Anonymous, Jun. 2015 Pros:Nice pool and courtyard. Airport shuttle, flight information and scale for baggage were very helpful. Good food in the restaurant. Cons:Thin walls and heavy doors made it hard to sleep with people coming and going. The quality of the restaurant was good, but wishes there was more variety. There are no other food options without taking a taxi. A 9.7 Wonderful Anonymous, Apr. 2015 Pros:convenient if your flight gets in late, free airport shuttle, newish hotel, reasonably good breakfast buffet included in hotel price, nice garden with swimming pool that the kids will love. And overall good value for the money Cons:The hotel was clean but the carpet was still full of other peoples hair, so many that you could see it on a dark blue carpet. If you are expecting a unique touch or experience this might not be the place for you. The hotel and it´s decor is tried-and-proven corporate Marriott non-descriptive design and architecture that could be transplanted anywhere in the world. Then again some people might consider this safe.
