Super smooth landing." Cons: "Nothing." Pros: "Premium seats were more comfortable, crew in our section was great, newer airplane was lovely, food and drink were really good." Cons: "Can’t think of anything within WestJet’s control that was bad." Cons: "Minor point. They boarded the plane very early. We got to the gate 1/2 hour before departure, and were almost the last ones to board." Pros: "Didn't see much of crew. Food was crazy expensive for what it was." Cons: "Better food for price, or an option to pre-book a proper meal at time of buying ticket. Plane was cold and no blankets." Pros: "The plane was nice and quiet, and the crew was lovely." Cons: "It was so cold!!" Pros: "I did not make it on the flight as the time was given was 5:35 and the flight left at 4:00." Cons: "I was not given correct information and being a very novice traveller did not check the information." Pros: "Boarding was easy, crew was pretty friendly and we reached London an hour early which was brilliant." Cons: "Maybe let us know in advance that there's no TV's in the plane, or meals. Leg room for someone who's 6'4" is non existent, especially when the person in front of you puts their seat back." Pros: "Crew were great, service was spot on." Cons: "Plane was old, seat didn't recline, no tv screens in front of seats, temperature was freezing (but in fairness I was at the emergency exit) and worst of all NO MEAL?? ON A NINE HOUR FLIGHT? Arrived very hungry." Pros: "Airport counter staff v helpful. Crew were great. Helped lady with 2 kids. Looked after 1 while mom changing other." Cons: "Need more seat room. No entertainment."
