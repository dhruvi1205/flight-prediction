KAYAK’s top tips for renting a car in Bangkok In Bangkok, rush hours in the morning start from 7:30 am to 9:30 am, while in the evening, from 5 pm to 7:30 pm. The congestion is only on a few roads in the center, so cheap car rentals in Bangkok should avoid operating in the center during rush hours. The roads experiencing the worst congestion during rush hours include Sukhumvit Rod, Rama IV Road, Petchaburi Road, Sathorn Road, and Silom Road. Moreover, vehicles from the side streets and car parks often move slowly into the traffic. Vehicles already on the trafficked road should give way to those joining, which can be frustrating. However, try not to run out of patience and be aggressive in your driving when this happens. During rush hours, we recommend finding parking outside central Bangkok and using the MRT or BTS systems to get around in the center since they are efficient and affordable. Anyone operating cheap car rentals in Bangkok should not drink and drive. The law set a maximum BAC limit of 0.05% for all drivers in the city. Drivers with less than five years of driving experience have a lower BAC limit of 0.02%. Local drivers signal Bangkok car rentals by rolling down windows and calling out to alert you when they switch lanes. The vehicle to the left has a right-of-way if two vehicles approach a junction from different directions. Avoid parking in certain areas such as Siam Square since you might get locked in. The Thai addressing system applies to addresses in Bangkok. Large roads are thanon “Th’ while roads branching off them, side streets, are soi. The numbering of sois is by even numbers on one side and odd numbers on the other. Larger streets change names after a few miles. The names of these streets will depend on the neighborhoods they run through. For instance, Sukhumvit Road is along the Sukhumvit area, while Phloen Chit runs along the Phloen Chit area. Bangkok has a myriad of amazing attractions and fantastic sights to offer and is probably one of the most exciting cities worldwide. Explore everything in the capital of Thailand and rent a car to gain ultimate flexibility and freedom. A rental car will not only allow you to reach all attractions in Bangkok easily, including the beach, but will also give you the opportunity to explore Thailand beyond the city borders and find other interesting places like Pattaya City, about 2 hours from Bangkok by car. Pick up your rental car conveniently at the Suvarnabhumi Airport when you arrive and drive directly to your next destination. Rental car companies like Avis, Budget, or Europcar are located at the airport, and signs bring you from the terminal to the rental service desks. The airport is located outside of the city center, so with a car you’ll reach it within an hour of driving. Bear in mind that some of the roads to the city may include tolls, so ask at the rental car center how to operate them. Bangkok is a very busy city with lots of traffic, but the infrastructure is pretty good. However, Bangkok is also a city of motorbikes and they have a reputation to whizz in and out of the streets and between the cars. Adjust your speed and stay alert and this issue should pose as no problem. Also bear in mind that traffic signs are in Thai and English, but the English spelling can vary from street sign to street sign. In Thailand cars drive on the left side of the road. For travelers who are not used to this, consider opting for a satnav, which will help you stay in the right lane, and also follow the drivers ahead of you, especially when entering a roundabout or intersection. 25% of our users found rental cars in Bangkok for C$ 39 or less Book your rental car in Bangkok at least 4 days before your trip in order to get a below-average price Off-airport rental car locations in Bangkok are around 1% cheaper than airport locations on average Compact rental cars in Bangkok are around 43% cheaper than other car types, on average Bangkok car rental experiences: the best tips from KAYAK users Insights shared by verified travelers who rented a car in Bangkok Learn how KAYAK collects reviews and tips from users.

An economy car is a safe bet when driving in Bangkok, as it will be easier to navigate through the narrow lanes, and also will fit into more of the rather limited parking opportunities.

On-street parking is very limited in Bangkok, but there are parking opportunities in malls or next to parks for a charge.

The Thrifty counter at BKK is co-located with Hertz, conveniently at the airport. The folks at the counter spoke perfect English and were really helpful with all of our questions. We were able to add a second driver for no cost and there was no hassle about declining extra insurance, which we didn't need due to having it through our credit card. Best of all, they had the car waiting for us at the airport, having been brought to us from the off-site location. (We did have to return at the off-site location, but there was zero wait for the shuttle bus to get to the airport.) Even though we had booked the smallest/cheapest available model, the car we were given was plenty roomy for 4 adults and all of our luggage. I'm not sure if we were given an upgrade, or if all of their cars are just that nice, but we were really happy with it. Driving in Thailand was no problem outside of Bangkok (which we had seen earlier by taxi). Having a car made it really simple, convenient, comfortable, and cost-effective for the 4 of us to visit outlying areas like Khao Yai and Ayutthaya. Driving is on the left, like Australia and England, but Thai drivers are so polite it's easy to merge and traffic is not too fast nor too slow - really perfect. I highly recommend it. 9.6 Wonderful Feb. 2017 Pros:Everything! Cons:The price! 5.2 Fair Oct. 2016 Pros:1. I liked that the counter is right in the main terminal. 2. I liked that the car was located directly outside the counter location. Cons:1. I did not like that there was no "Thrifty" sign at the car rental counters location. I asked several of the other rental desk workers where I could find Thrifty, and none of them knew. Finally I was told that I should go to the Hertz counter if I wanted to rent from Thrifty. 2. I did not like that the return procedure is disorganized. We were told to call the number on the paper that was attached to my rental agreement prior to returning the car. I called this number and got a recording. I returned the car at approximately 0330am and had to park quite a distance away from where I picked up the car because private vehicles were not allowed to enter the area where I originally picked the car up. The signs to show where to return are not well placed or do not properly explain where to go to return a Thrifty or Hertz car. I parked the vehicle in the commercial bus area and when I walked into the terminal and to the Thrifty counter, I found the agent sleeping on the desk. 3. The agents that Thrifty use speak little or no English. I had to ask an agent from another rental company to assist with communication. 4. When I picked up the vehicle the fuel tank was not full, yet the agent circled FULL, I had to seek assistance from another renter to speak Thai with the agent and explain that the fuel tank was not full, and that I was not accepting the vehicle with F circled.

They constantly shorted out and were nearly useless. When we returned from our trip and attempted to return the van, your customer service had claimed they could pick up the van for us; however, we were left on our own and had to return the van to a different budget.
