KAYAK’s top tips for renting a car in Calgary Get to see most parts of Calgary in the comfort of your own cheap car rental. Most likely, you will want to visit Prince’s Island Park, which is a 7-minute drive or approximately 2.2miles (3,5km) from the city center, or tour the famous Calgary Tower before heading to main downtown spots such as Fort Calgary and Bow River. On weekends, you may drive 9.7 miles (15.6km) from downtown Calgary to Bowmont Park to enjoy the city’s spectacular views or drive west, a distance of around 46.7 miles (75.1km), to have a picturesque view of Kananaskis mountainous areas. Choose your ride from the available Calgary car rentals and have some fun while your vacation lasts. Rent a vehicle from Downtown Calgary to conveniently travel around and outside the city for official or tourism reasons. The car hire companies in downtown make it easy for you to pick out the best set of wheels for your travel needs. Choose your perfect rental car from companies such as Hertz, Alamo, Avis, Enterprise, Dollar, Driving Force, Budget, and Thrifty and venture out and about whenever and wherever you feel like doing so during your stay in Calgary. All you need to do is to visit one of the numerous car hire offices in central Calgary, especially along the 1st Street or Macleod Trail corridor, present your car booking documents, pick up the vehicle of your choice and start your exploration in style. If you are looking to drive around Calgary, you need to know that the city uses the metric system. What this means is that all distances and speed limits are marked in kilometers. The city also makes it mandatory for drivers and even passengers to wear seat belts at all times. Plus, the city makes it illegal to use mobile devices or cell phones while driving. In the winter months, check with the local meteorological department for weather reports and real-time driving conditions before getting around. Make sure to confirm with the Department of Motor Vehicles in Calgary for new traffic laws before picking up your car rental. Calgary is a paradise for lovers of the great outdoors. Situated at the junction of the Bow and Elbow Rivers and with the Canadian Rockies on your doorstep, exploring the surroundings of Calgary is a dream with a rental car. The world famous Banff National Park is only a little over an hour’s drive west and will leave you awestruck with the picturesque turquoise glacial lakes, untouched wilderness, and natural hot springs. Canada’s third largest city by population is located nearly 3,500 feet above sea level and has something to offer for every willing traveler. Once you land at Calgary International Airport and collect your baggage, follow the signage to the Car Rental Center elevator. On the second level you will find the counters of multiple major car rental companies including Hertz, Avis, Budget, and Thrifty. The drive from the airport to downtown is seamless along the AB-2 S Highway and will only take approximately 25 minutes. If you are heading to Banff National Park you can either take the Highway 1, which will allow you to pass through Calgary on the way, or the Stoney Trail (201) Highway, which is a more direct route. Canada, and specifically the mountain range, is blessed with wildlife that sometimes feels an explorative urge and wanders onto the roads. Be mindful when driving and keep an attentive eye out for animals. If you do approach any hazardous animals, remember to drive carefully and reduce speed. Thanks to its higher altitude, Calgary can experience significant snowfall in the winter months, causing difficult driving conditions. The roads are designed to best deal with this snowfall; however it is important that you follow some simple tips to increase your safety. Scrape any accumulated snow off your car before driving, paying extra attention to the windows and headlights. Listen to weather reports and adhere to any warnings; the city has a Traffic Advisory station which you can tune in to at 106.5 FM. Be mindful to reduce your speed when driving in poor conditions and be extra cautious around pedestrians. 25% of our users found rental cars in Calgary for C$ 39 or less Book your rental car in Calgary at least 1 day before your trip in order to get a below-average price Off-airport rental car locations in Calgary are around 39% more expensive than airport locations on average Supplier choice rental cars in Calgary are around 47% cheaper than other car types, on average Calgary car rental experiences: the best tips from KAYAK users Insights shared by verified travelers who rented a car in Calgary Learn how KAYAK collects reviews and tips from users. MoniqueSep. 2023 We were in Canmore. The drive to Canmore was easy and the road great. The nearest gas station we found to fill the car before returning it was at 430 Country Hills blvd NE, T3K 5A5.

Check in was easy and efficient. 8.0 Very good Oct. 2023For the past two years the wait at Avis Calgary is always so long, last year over an hour and a half but this year down to 50 minutes.

And we were very thankful for the upgrade! Thank you Budget!! 4.0 Mediocre Mar. 2023I do not understand the logic behind a car rental agency that is one hr from the Rockie mtns not listing only winter tire vehicles. To leave it as an upgrade and significant cost at the counter is outrageous. It may not be law to have winter tires on the vehicles being rentable, but highlight that fact on your booking site. It is misleading and not a fair price comparison. And, the amount of surcharges etc are obscene and should be disclosed on your final booking ONLINE, again NOT at the ticket counter when everyone is in a frenzy to get on the road to their destination. As well, there was no walk thru of the vehicle features like windshield wipers, lights, gas tank etc. At initial use of my wiper blades the wipers did not actually touch the glass and was left w a blob of frozen windshield fluid which I had to pullover and scrape off. Eventually the wipers must have warmed up and we’re operational. I was very dissatisfied w my experience and shocked at the outrageous cist of my online quote if $358 to walking away w a key for $958!!?

This was discovered after my ride left leaving me stranded on an unfamiliar road in an unfamiliar city in the cold at 5 PM when essentially everything was shutting down and derailing my plans completely. It looks like you over sold and now are pawning me off on the third party (carrentals.com) for resolution “in a few days.” The reservation was paid in advance for a rental that KAYAK was claiming to guarantee and failed to deliver. On your own website you write “we work hard as the world’s leading travel search engine to get our users the information they need so they can plan trips the way they want, confidently.” In big bold letters no less! What a crock, this was my first experience booking through you and I’ll be sure to tell everyone I know about my experience with KAYAK.

They walked us down to Hertz where we waited another 30 minutes in line only to be told we had to wait for a car. We waited 45 minutes. We ended up arriving to our destination over an hour late and missing an important dinner. The car itself was fine, but we will never rent from dollar again - when you add in the list time and missed dinner with colleagues, this was a very expensive rental and one we don’t want to repeat. There was no apology and no explanation - they oversold and did nothing. 6.8 Okay Mar. 2018 Pros:Friendly professional desk staff. Cons:The car has a slow leak in the right front tire. I wish I'd paid better attention to ensure the care had cruise control. Leaving the parkade on foot involves a trip through a nasty old stairwell and corridor where I thought I might get stabbed.

I called in a few months before to ask for either a Surburban or Yukon XL so it was great that Driving Force was able to accommodate my needs. This vehicle had all the added bells and whistles such as, adaptive cruise control, pretty good fuel mileage for it's size, collision sensors, A/C seats (front only), and a pretty bumping sound system. It definitely made it easier for me to feel safe and confident enough to drive the SUV since I normally drive a Mazda 3 so it was a big change for me. Cons:Honestly nothing to complain about! 8.4 Very good Jul. 2018 Pros:Great customer service at pick up. Shuttle service. Nice vehicle.

The staff at the front desk were very nice and professional. The problems began when selecting and picking up the car. We were asked to check the condition of a black car in an closed garage with poor lighting. Next to impossible. Then you have to show the problems to an agent who has some sort of screen to look further. About a dozen people were all leaving at once and so it took the better part of an hour from being shown the car to actually leaving the airport. Once we got it out into the light it was obvious we had missed a scratch. Upon dropping off, the process was very fast. However I wasn't given a receipt, and the one promised to my email never came.

Drop of was very easy and convenient. Cons:When we got to the airport we had to wait for two hours before getting the car because they didn't have any available. 2.0 Poor Sep. 2020 Pros:staff let you read the fine print. Cons:AVOID this rental car. have all sorts of hidden fees . while booking, it was 'unlimited mileage'. then because i am an Albertan renting in Calgary, it is 200kms per day and have to pay for extra mileage. RIPPED OFF , Used another rental agency last week to go to Victoria BC with real 'unlimited mileage"- well now i know how ROUTES works, i will never ever rent a car there. i actually declined and cancelled the car rental on that day, i went to another agency and get another car for unlimited mileage almost the same price. AVOID this agency ! 4.0 Mediocre Sep. 2020 Pros:no comments Cons:They have hidden fees, while booking, it was supposed to be unlimited mileage however since i am an Albertan ,it is not unlimited, it is 200kms per day and the agent told me you should have read the fine print . Thats fine! i missed it , i thought it would be "unlimited mileage" as it states . I rented a van from another agency a week ago in calgary , we went to VICTORIA BC with unlimited mileage . So folks, avoid this company , its ripped off - choose a better rental company ! 8.0 Very good Apr. 2019 Pros:staff were good 10.0 Wonderful Mar. 2019 Pros:Yes it was easy to find. Friendly staff as well. Cons:Not much everything was great. 10.0 Wonderful Mar. 2019 Pros:Shuttle from the airport. Customer service was great. Only a 500 deposit in Calgary vs 1500 deposit in Mississauga.

The lady who picked us up from the airport was nice. Overall it was horrible. Cons:It says they are at the airport, but they are actually 20 minutes from the airport, after you have to wait 20-30 minutes for them to pick you up. Coming back to the airport you need to factor in at least an hour because they only have one small shuttle and you do not know where it will be in route. 2.0 Poor May 2019 Cons:Shuttle never showed up at airport to pick up because my pickup time was close to closing. Reservation had incorrect phone for car rental place. Number was to a local hotel, therefore getting direct contact with car rental was a hassle. Had to book a car with different company at airport. 4.0 Mediocre Apr. 2019 Cons:The car was not safe to be on the road. Tires were completely bare. 2.0 Poor Feb. 2019 Cons:Bait and switch for rental car Insurance 2.4 Poor Dec. 2018 Pros:I liked that we were able to have unlimited driving allowance. It was a bonus having a vehicle with command start. Cons:The vehicle didn't have bluetooth. The windshield had cracks in it and continued to crack as small chunks of snow hit the windshield (it was a Jeep). When I booked the rental, I received a detailed invoice stating I would be charged $137 CAD but when I went to pick up the car, I was charged $178 CAD. When I brought it up, I was told I had to call in to the website which was closed. It was upsetting ever since we picked up the car. I would not recommend Economy Rent a Car to anyone. I would gladly pay more to have a better experience at just about any other rental agency. 6.8 Okay Nov. 2018 Pros:The price is very good, and the staff was friendly. They even called the night before to see what time I landed and asked for my flight info going over what their pickup process was going to be. Cons:This company takes a while to pick you up and get you to their offsite location (20-30 min) which is a small room inside a hotel. The car didn’t have enough windshield washing fluid which could have made the trip up the mountains very dangerous if I didn’t catch it while I was still near civilization. They were very picky while checking the condition of the car with me. Had me use my phone flashlight as it was dark out so they could write down ever scratch and chip on the body (and there ended up being a considerable amount) which makes me glad that I took the insurance (who knows if they missed a tiny scratch?) The vehicle was past due on an oil change for over 2,000 km at the time of pick up. My reservation was for a Toyota rav 4 or similar ( I love Toyota’s) and their only options were a dodge pickup truck, or 3 types of kia’s.
