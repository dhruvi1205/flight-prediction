Cons: "It would have been better if the flight wasn't delayed got hours while we were stuck on a plane!!" Pros: "The crew went out of his way to help us!" Cons: "The landing was the worst I have ever experienced! Must be a student pilot or something! Been traveling for many years and never once vomit! I almost did in this flight! twice!!" Cons: "No explanation was given why flight left almost 2 hours late" Cons: "Don't like having to download app for entertainment....some devices not current enough to download.. Not everyone has devices Kids disappointed..prefer Alaska monitors" Pros: "Pleasant Staff Great flight" Cons: "that i paid to get a seat next to my brother and the plane was not full and people got to sit where they liked. it cost me more money for nothing." Pros: "Boarding, flight, and deplaning great.our seats were pre booked by West Jet and were the window and aisle seat. My husband is 6’5” and needs an aisle seat. We prefer to book our own seats at no cost. Fortunately our seat mate wanted to change too." Pros: "The staff on board made us completely forget we just experienced a terrible 6 hour experience in the hands of westjet from punta cana. The airport staff and security were efficient and all friendly. Helped us every step of the way. But again, a big thank you to the 4 flight attendants on the ws 254 to Halifax. Made our crappy day much better simply by being a friendly and happy face." Cons: "Didnt like having to connect but understand that was to my own booking." Cons: "We didnt have enough time to make the connection between the fly . We ran for all aeropuert and almost loss the fly to Lax" Pros: "Easy check in and nice crew!!!! No complaints at all!!! I would fly them again!!! I would definitely recommend them to others!" Can't be happy with a 5 hour delay. Only given $10 voucher for food and still EVERYTHING was an upcharge during the flight. TThe first time I have ever flown with flare and both ways sucked There was no entertainment There was no food or beverage service , not even a glass of water The plane door could not be opened upon arrival I try to buy water the cabin crews told me I had to wait for them to come around with the trolley I waited over 2 hours !!!!! Literally 2 hours I was so thirsty . Lots of leg room in the front rows. Wish water was free. I don't like anything. The crew was so bad. Misbehaved badly. The worst flight. Long wait for baggage check in with only one on site attendant. The worst airlines I have seen in my life they don’t respect anyone they don’t care about anyone they lost our luggage and no one is responding. We waited for five hours to get our luggage back.🤬🤬🤬👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 Great staff. Cramped seating for someone 5 feet, 2 inches and average weight. So if you're tall or heavy -- good luck. Even if you wait until the 24 hour checkin time, you still charge for seating. Really? So either it is a less-than-pleasant experience or pay the price of a "big name" airline. And if I'm going to pay their prices, why would I fly in your cramped seat? So, in the end, you want to give less comfort for the same prices as Air Canada. Go figure. The airplane smokes and they think it's normal.... this is sign of deterioration Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "The flight was late for one hour . We did not have any information why . My driver in Zurich left and I have to pay another cab from Zurich to Kreuzlingen . Nobody from the airline could do anything about ."
