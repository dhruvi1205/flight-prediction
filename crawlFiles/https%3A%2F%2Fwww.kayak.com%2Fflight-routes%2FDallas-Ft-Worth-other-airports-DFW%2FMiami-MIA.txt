In seat entertainment option, bring headphones. Accommodating crew. Beverage and snacks provided at no cost." Pros: "Seat was comfortable, boarding was good" Cons: "WiFi didn’t work, my tv didn’t work either" Cons: "Nothing, really. Airlines unfortunately can’t make people patient or polite, & I can’t afford a private jet, so I’ll have to settle for an eye roll or twelve." Pros: "The poor cabin stewardess was working the whole time as it was a short flight." Cons: "This is a horrible route, they charge you more than flying to Europe and give you a one hour ride in a cramped plane where you can't even bring in a carry-on. The cost is insane but is one of the reasons Wall Street loves Delta as they are racking in the profits for very little service." Pros: "Comfort and service was great." Cons: "The severe delays was frustrating and not getting enough information about it." Pros: "The crew was great and the service was quick and very nice." Cons: "It sounds weird but I didn’t know which window was mine so I had one shut and the one in front of me shut during the flight." Cons: "We were already very delayed, the flight crew was not nice" Pros: "The comfort the professionalism of the staff everywhere I went" Cons: "Little pricey on rental and hotel." Pros: "Quickly boarded and took off as well. It was a really smooth flight!" Pros: "Nothing, 2 hrs delay waiting for a crew member and plane was ~25% full, no snacks or beverages" Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "The aircraft looks like a WWI aircraft. So dirty. Floors were nasty with food not picked up from the last trip. Sits are extremely uncomfortable even for a 2 hr flogjt. Last minute flight so we had to do frontier... never again thou" Pros: "I survived!" Cons: "Disruptive passenger should have been removed! The flight was delayed 2 hours." Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "At least let the people with no baggage go 1st" Pros: "Really nice crew, really efficient boarding, I loved my seat assignment and the price was RIGHT!" Cons: "Couldn't recline the seats, pretty harsh that you don't even get pretzels but I get it y'all." Pros: "On time" Cons: "Extremely high charge for carry-on baggage, extremely high charge for changing flight times, no beverage service, seats are very small with no iPhone charger available." Cons: "I don't like the seats, they have no cushion and they don't recline. Plus the tray table is super small. Also you pay for all drinks. Another thing the pressure is horrible in these planes. It seems they try to cut down on cost so the cabin is not pressurized right to reduced your ears from getting the over pressure from the ascend and descent of the plane." Pros: "Quick flight." Cons: "The seats don't go back, but you get what you pay for last minute." Pros: "Nothing really after paying $45 and l have to pay another $45 to go back to Cincinnati" Cons: "Too much luggage fee $45 is too much" Pros: "Price Comfort You can pack a backpack for a short trip and not pay baggage fees. Haven't had a delay in a long while. No cancelled flights since flying with them Boarding is typically fast and we typically arrive 15-30min early" Cons: "Crew is hit or miss Price of onboard snacks is ridiculous" Pros: "Timely flight." Cons: "Being charged for a seat and overhead luggage. That will cause me to favor another carrier. Thanks." Pros: "Everything. The best flight I’ve had in a long time." Cons: "All was good!" Cons: "we Had more space as far as seating on our way out but our flight back seemed like a tighter squeeze. But every thing else was good." Cons: "I did not like the fact that they up charge everything. I have flown everywhere. And never been charged for my back pack. On spirit they charge 65 for a simple carry on backpack." Pros: "I liked this would be my last Spirit flight ever!" Cons: "4.5 hours late for starters." Pros: "We got here early and it was a very very smooth flight." Pros: "It was better than I expected. The landing was perfect!" Cons: "That they charge for everything." Pros: "Liked the way Spirit Airlines were transparent in letting us know all the additional charges at the time of booking itself." Cons: "entertainment system can be added to the flights , as we don't get coffe or Tea for free , we can be occupied by watching some channel." Pros: "Price and size and age of the plane." Cons: "Was not aware of additional baggage charges at the time of the reservation." Pros: "Smiley hosts." Cons: "There is no complimentary drinks or snacks. Bus like seats.
