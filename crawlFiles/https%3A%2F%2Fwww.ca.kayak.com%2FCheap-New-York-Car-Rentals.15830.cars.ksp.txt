KAYAK’s top tips for renting a car in New York There are several toll roads and bridges in New York. I-87, I-90, and the New York Thruway in Upstate New York are tolled. You’ll pay a toll for all tunnels and bridges from New Jersey to Manhattan. Most bridges and tunnels in New York will need you to pay a toll fee. However, bridges like Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queensborough, and Williamsburg are toll-free. The toll payments are in cash for most of the tunnels and bridges. However, cash payments do not apply for tolls on the Bayonne Bridge and Outerbridge Crossing. Several highways connect New York City to New York state. Learn about these routes and navigate cheap car rentals in New York smoothly throughout New York State. The main motorway serving all boroughs in New York is Interstate 278. It also connects New York to New Jersey. The Long Island Expressway is the route from midtown Manhattan to the east of Long Island. The road connecting most parts of the city is 7th Avenue. It starts from Greenwich Village to Central Park and runs through Times Square and Midtown. The drive from John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to lower Manhattan takes approximately 30 minutes. The distance is about 18 miles. From the rental parking lot, head to the Cargo Service Road. Continue for a few minutes, then take a right to N Service Road. Join the slip road by taking the first exit on N Service Road. Then, turn onto I-678 N and continue driving for about seven miles. Join I-395 W by taking exit 12B. At exit 17 W, use the right two lanes, then join I-278 W for another about four miles. Take exit 29 and follow the road signs heading to Brooklyn Bridge. Take the second exit to make a right turn onto the bridge, which leads straight to lower Manhattan. One of the major advantages of renting a car in New York City is that it makes the outlying boroughs much more accessible. For instance, places like Rockaway Beach in Queens, Red Hook in Brooklyn, and City Island in the Bronx are all much easier to reach via car than by public transportation. For travelers with flights landing at LaGuardia Airport, all rental shuttles pick up and drop off from in front of Terminal A of the airport. As for JFK International Airport, rental car desks can be found on the Arrivals level of each terminal. At Newark International Airport, the car rental desks are found in Stations P2 and P3 on the AirTrain. Rush hour is an undeniable part of life in New York City. However, that doesn’t mean it can’t be mitigated. Typically morning the busy morning traffic lasts from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m., while the afternoon and evening traffic is usually from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. Drivers should take care, though, that those are the busiest times, but often rush hour can start even earlier in the morning and last even later at night. Some of the main areas to avoid during rush hour include the Lincoln Tunnel and the Brooklyn Bridge.

BillOct. 2023 If you rent a car at JFK or La Guardia from Avis make sure to check that they're is a FULL TANK of GAS in the car & make sure to check that there is no damage to the car you're renting.

Bummer that they invested in this fleet and it isn't paying off, but when I found myself in rural Vermont, in the rain, in the dark, with my kid, at yet another broken charging station, I wasn't really concerned with their bottom line. What I didn't know when I accepted the rental: driving an EV is something a person has to be prepared for, and almost no one leaving the city is going to have an easy time in they don't have experience. We made it, and again, the staff at Hertz did fine by what they had to work with, but overall, we spent almost an hour looking for/charging the car for every hour of driving. So yeah, thumbs down... 10.0 Wonderful Sep. 2023I liked the friendliness of the staff . They were courteous and professional. They answered all my questions and made sure that everything went smoothly. I say again, the staff was very, very friendly! 2.0 Poor Nov. 2022The clerk wasn’t welcoming and friendly.

I was making a 5.5 hour drive and was not prepared for the logistics of a EV (where to find reliable list of locations for chargers, etc) and therefore was forced to pay to 'upgrade' because they had no other cars in the class I purchased. That's their problem, not mine, but i was forced to pay anyway. 10.0 Wonderful Jul. 2021Great vehicle, very clean and quick service. Better rates than we saw at other places. Fast and convenient pickup and drop-off. We paid upfront but be aware that at pick-up you will be charged taxes and other small fees, so we actually went above our projected budget than what our online charge showed. 2.0 Poor May 2021 Pros:Not an enjoyable experience at all Cons:Pickup — staff was both rude and incompetent. When picking up, I asked to change my dropoff date. After huffing about it, the staff person told me the new price... but conveniently forgot to update the reservation because I was later charged an early return fee. So then I obviously had to call to get it reversed — which no one likes wasting their time doing. Why couldn’t this have been simple and seamless, as usual? Only one reason - the staff. Dropoff — again, the staff person was exceptionally rude. She asked me to get in line when I was only literally mentioning that I was dropping off. Not EVERYONE is trying to cut in line all the time! Sometimes we just don’t want to wait for 6 other people to get helped for a 1 second FYI! 10.0 Wonderful May 2021 Pros:Excellent Cons:- 2.0 Poor May 2021 Cons:My reservation was for 3pm. I arrived a little after 3 and the rental location was closed. Nowhere on the app or in the reservation process was it made clear that the location closed at 3. I tried to make another reservation somewhere, but the Kayak app showed no cars available anywhere. Literally none. Very, very disappointed in the whole experience. And I’d like a refund of the $22 pre-paid in insurance for a car I never got.

I picked the car up around 9:30 PM & had a 90 drive to my house. As I left the parking lot of AVIS at JFK & got on the parkway heading north to my home I noticed that there wasn't a FULL TANK OF GAS in the car. I had less than ¼ Tank of gas in the AVIS Rental Car. I then had to try to find a gas station that was opened after 10 PM. The WARNING LIGHT came on the dash board letting me know that I would probably run out of gas before I arrived to my home. I luckily found a gas station that was opened off the parkway & put more gas in the car then I originally got at the JFK AVIS location. This should never have happened. I should have had a FULL TANK of GAS when I left the AVIS location at JFK & I should be reimbursed for this rental or my next one on Nov. 20th at Westchester (White Plains).Reservation # 23531515USO 2.0 Poor Aug. 2023We had to wait over two and a half hours (in an un-air-conditioned building on a very hot day) to get our car. I would have thought that maybe this was an unusually busy day or something, but there was no acknowledgment from the staff that this experience was out of the ordinary. We rented from them again a couple weeks later, since we had already made the booking and didn’t have time to change it. There was still no air conditioning in the building, but at least there was no line this time. Even so, we still had to wait 45 minutes before we got our car. It is not clear to me why it took so long. We won’t rent a car from them again if we can avoid it…we’d rather pay a bit more money and see if one of the other companies has more reasonable waiting times (or at least air conditioning if we have to wait for a long time). 10.0 Wonderful Oct. 2022I was surprised and happy how streamlined pick up and drop off were.

Cons:When we received our car, the tire pressure light was on. We connected with an employee who filled the tires with air. When finished, the light was still on, but the employee said that "it's because the tires need some time to warm up" (it had snowed two days in a row previously). We had a car for a total of three days and two nights. The tire pressure light never turned off. I wish the employee had taken more care to look into the issue and/or escalate the matter so that we could receive a new car.

" Mandatory liability insurance, concession fees that weren't mentioned online and $44 for a toll pass which I chose to add). None of which were mentioned online when reserving and paying "In Full".

The employee at the counter is just the beginning of the worst rental experience you can ever imagine. I was forced to buy insurance even though my credit card provide coverage in case of an issue with any rental car. Then I was requested flight information even though, as a student, I am allowed to stay in the country without having a flight back; they make you feel uncomfortable. Finally, the worst is yet to come. We had a nail puncture, and they charged us 200$ for a tire replacement without any explanation when a fix would have cost 60$; to finish up the bill, they had mistakenly doubled the tax and fee. 4.0 Mediocre Sep. 2023I would have appreciated more transparency around the eventual cost of the vehicle. I was initially quoted $290 when I reserved it, and was told that would be the amount when I picked it up. Alas, I was presented with a daily "Geo Zone" fee— something I wasn't notified of when renting the car. I dropped the car off after requesting an additional day (I tried to do so at pick-up, but was told I'd have to call to extend), and was charged a total of $457. Additionally, I thought I would be renting the car from ACE, a company I've heard of, but was surprised to learn that I'd actually be renting it from Drivo (a company I've never heard of). I was also told I could receive $25 back, if I submitted a Google review, prior to even leaving the lot with the car The lack of transparency made me very uncomfortable. In the future, I'll stick to (albeit sometimes pricey) companies I know, like Hertz. 2.0 Poor Sep. 2023Long lines bad costmer service 2.0 Poor May 2021 Pros:Nothing Cons:The manager at Ace was very rude and had me on the do not rent list for keeping the car a few days longer than the reservation.

However, before you hit the road, there are some essential things you need to know. Laura Ratliff 12 June 2023 New York City is on everyone’s travel bucket list. However, getting around the city can be challenging, with crowded public transport and constant traffic jams. Renting a car in New York City can provide a convenient and comfortable way to navigate the city’s five boroughs - and beyond. But with the fast-paced lifestyle and busy streets, driving in the city can be daunting for first-time visitors. Knowing the various regulations, requirements, and challenges of driving in the city is essential. Here’s how to ensure a safe and enjoyable driving experience in the city that never sleeps.

You may need an international driver’s license and your home country’s license if you are an international visitor. Most car rental agencies require drivers to be at least 21, but some may have a minimum age requirement of 25. You will also need a credit card for the rental deposit and insurance purposes. Many agencies do not accept cash or debit card deposits. The best type of car to rent in New York City New York City has various car rental options, from economy cars to luxury SUVs. However, due to the city’s narrow streets and limited parking spaces, renting a compact or mid-size vehicle is recommended for easy maneuvering. Where to get a rental car in New York City Major car rental agencies have multiple locations throughout New York City, with the most extensive selection available at the city’s airports. If you arrive at one of the city’s airports (JFK, EWR, LGA) you can easily find the rental car offices in or near the terminal. Most rental agencies offer shuttle services to transport customers to their rental location if it is not within walking distance.
