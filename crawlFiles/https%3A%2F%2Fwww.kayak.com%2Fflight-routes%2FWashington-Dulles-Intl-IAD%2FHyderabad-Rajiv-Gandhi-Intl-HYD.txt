Don’t know if that can be prevented." Pros: "The cabin crew was pretty good. This was the only saving grace in otherwise very poor experience" Cons: "The flight was delayed by 2 hours and they changed the gate from one end of the terminal (A15) to the other (C1). The waiting area was cramped. This being the home of Singapore Airlines, the way managed this entire thing was pathetic. Boarding announcements were also confusing." Pros: "Extra leg room, great service and good food." Cons: "The entertainment system feels dated (no touch screen) manual rewinding of movies, selection of movies" Pros: "The comfort and caring staff" Cons: "Food serve a bit slow with the no of pax and long queue for the washroom" Pros: "Emirates is my airline of choice.

The customer service person was very rude too." Pros: "My flight left on time and from the moment I was greeted upon entering the A380 Airbus, I knew I was in for something very special. As prepared for departure, blankets and pillows were distributed amongst the passengers. Once in flight, dinner and in the morning, breakfast. And, throughout the night, the flight attendants attended to passenger requests for beverages and snacks. The plane was clean and, maybe I need to compliment my fellow passengers also, for the washrooms were clean and well maintained. We arrived on time and the trip seemed rather short with the entertainment of movies, news and inflight updates.

Pros: "Fantastic flight...Qatar’s QSuites are fantastic, very comfortable, Amazon my service from the crew, fantastic entertainment options, and with the privacy of the suite ...very close to first class...in fact it is better than the first products (from a seat perspective) of many other airlines such as United, Delta, Virgin, BA, etc." Cons: "I wish there were more vegetarian options on the menu" Pros: "I was fortunate the person in front didn’t lean back" Cons: "On Swiss website I added Rehe preference for a lactose free meal — but none were on the plane.

Pros: "They have a policy of letting kids under 5 board early which was a boon to us! The veggie pasta was really delicious." Cons: "The delay to fly was the only issue" Pros: "Liked nothing. Stewards were no help. Seating was extremely tight. I am disabled and use a small travel scooter. They removed the batteries even though they are not lithium or spillable. I called months in advance with all specifications and still they were clueless. We will never fly Swiss again. I am disabled and received no help. They removed the batteries of my scooter and we had to carry them on our lap. I had to tell them to put the batteries back in the scooter. They failed in every facet." Cons: "Nothing" Pros: "The crew were helpful and polite" Cons: "The boarding process was too long and chaotic in Zurich The seats are uncomfortably close together and there is not enough room to move at all.

Pros: "The seating in upper class is unconventional and uncomfortable." Cons: "Reconfigure seating in upper class. We will no longer be customers for that reason alone.." Pros: "Excellent airline" Cons: "The business seats could have been wider. I have sat on business class other airlines and the seat was a bit wider but overall still great experience" Pros: "Karl was amazing! So helpful and sweet!" Cons: "Having the crew tell the guy behind me to plug in his ear phones to watch the video in his phone, rather than me after 20 minutes of noise." Cons: "Unfortunately because the flight was delayed 2 times I was going to going to miss my connect flight to London. So I canceled my trip. I would appreciate a refund as I don’t understand what all the delays were about" Pros: "Crew was very nice. Food was very good and plentiful. Entertainment was good. Overall the very long flight was better than expected." Cons: "It took forever to board in Sydney with all passengers standing and waiting for 45 minutes and never being told what was going on.
