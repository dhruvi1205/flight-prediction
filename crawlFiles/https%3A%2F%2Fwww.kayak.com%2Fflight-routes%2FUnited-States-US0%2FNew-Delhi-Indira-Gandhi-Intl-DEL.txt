I had to go hungry for 10 hours the first flight and 12 hours the second one. They said they did not receive my special request for a vegetarian meal and they were very rude about it.

Pros: "The flight attendants are the most professional and attentive employees I've ever had the pleasure to be served by." Cons: "The movie selection could have been much better for such a long flight." Pros: "Crew service was amazing - so diligent and courteous. They were incredibly well trained and I would rate their service level as being one of the most competitive within business class in Asia." Cons: "Seats were reasonably comfortable but not as spacious in design as in other business class cabins, so that could be a concern for some travelers. Also, I was not able to convert the main menu of the entertainment system to my preferred language so it was a bit difficult to navigate (that being said, they provided a card that guided me, so it was still usable, and the entertainment selection was good!)." Pros: "Just excellent. Excellent crew, excellent food, excellent aircraft, and excellent leg room. No recommendations." Pros: "Economy was surprisingly comfortable. Boarding and deplaning were very quick." Cons: "Not a ton of movies to choose from. Enough, but less than most domestic US flights." Pros: "I like how the crew made rounds hourly to provide drinks and ensure we are good! Also appreciated when they were able to accommodate last minute meal changes!!" Pros: "The entertainment system, the leg room, the toilets with complimentary tooth brushes. JAL hit it out of the park." Cons: "Not one thing." Pros: "The cabin crew was excellent -- friendly, always helpful, energetic." Cons: "We requested a seafood special meal. The food quality was satisfactory, but most of the items tasted very bland. The accompanying dishes were unimaginative -- raw vegetables (salad), steamed vegetables, pickled vegetables. One exeption was a smoked salmon bit with capers -- this was the tastiest part among 8 meals over 4 flights." Pros: "One of the JAL ground crew was fantastic at Narita airport. I didn’t have enough time to get on my next flight. She provided me full assistance to take me to the connecting flight gate on time." Cons: "Several flight attendants gave me wrong drinks." Cons: "Business class seats not very long if you are tall. Western meal option is not really very western. Crew is a little too efficient- got woken up 90 minutes before landing to clear the mattresses. Lots of announcements- a bit too much. On time, and quick to respond to requests. Sake was good as was the ramen." Pros: "Singapore Airlines has everything worked out for you before you land. That's a great help. The stewardesses were just phenomenal and endlessly polite. I will definitely use them again." Cons: "As much as I normally nitpick something, I literally have no criticism at all of Singapore Airlines. Everything they did was a step above everyone else." Pros: "Crew was super nice and the food was good (for plane food)! Really appreciated that they had snacks and chocolate on hand for hungry passengers throughout the flight. A 17 hour plane ride is never the best, but Singapore Air made it as pleasant as possible. Also, we booked on Kayak and was routed through a third party vendor JustFly, which I was a little worried about - but our booking went off without a hitch." Cons: "Flight was a little warm but was able to get it cooler via help from crew but got warmer again towards the end of flight. Overall good flight though" Pros: "Excellent crew and very well dressed and always smiling" Cons: "The lights were switched off for a very long time. That can be avoided" Cons: "The lunch part at the end was a little late we had just had a snack and a small sandwich so we didn't eat a lot. But food was great!" Pros: "crew handled the tough crowd well, but were not extremely hospitable" Cons: "food was disgusting" Pros: "Flight was full but crew was attentive and very pleasant. Star Alliance Lounge at LAX had a good variety of food and drinks - Asian, western, small bites, snacks; red, white, bubbly and even a bartender who'll mix up cocktails. I love flying SQ." Cons: "For a premium economy service, it was really good." Pros: "The crew did a wonderful job of anticipating needs and having all the little ammenities you could want." Cons: "They gave you a menu at the start of the flight but didn't serve any of that food, and the food wasn't very good" Pros: "Handset to control screen didn’t work. Airline reimbursed me with $75 voucher for inflight duty-free shop." Cons: "Aircrew took my carry on away while I was waiting to board saying it was too large; left me without the essential items I wanted during the 19.5 hours in the air and two plane changes. Other people were allowed to keep carry ons bigger than mine so I don't understand why they did this." Dirty plane. Urine on floor of lavatories, food was not cleaned from previous leg of flight prior to boarding, lavatories only cleaned once inflight. Boarded by group number, but did not inform passengers in terminal. So standing in line for ~40min. Pros: "I had to pay two tickets for same flight from Islamabad to San Francisco and going from San Francisco to Islamabad it’s been cancel and I am fighting for my money back they don’t want to refund it" Pros: "Food and crew was good" Cons: "An adults only section would be great as there were a lot of screaming children on board, also seats were a bit on the small side" Pros: "Food is amazing, planes are good." Cons: "The boarding crew at the gate did not say anything while weighing the carry on bag. I was ask to go to another person who issued me check in baggage sticker and told me to hand over your baggage to a person inside. At last he mentioned to not put any valuables in that bag. My carry on bag was just 1lb extra and the first person could have told me right away and I would have thrown away chocolates and brought down the weight to permissible limit. In general passenger do carry valuable stuff in carry on bag. I had to follow whatever I was told." Pros: "The crew was nice" Cons: "Better food and cooked throughly and better seat and more blankets." Pros: "Plane was modern and more comfortable than most" Cons: "I do understand that it was an overnight flight but the crew came around only during meals and at no other time did they check on us. I hit the call button and nobody came - call button just went off. I was in the middle next to a sleeping passenger and could not get up." Cons: "Mechanical problems delayed the flight 1 1/2 hours. Other than that, the flight was good." Pros: "Supportive to my family needs traveling with 2 babies" Cons: "I was offered an upgrade to 1st class, but not to my wife, I m thankful but had to decline the upgrade. I was hoping for more courtesy for an upgrade to us both as traveling couple rather than to one only" Pros: "The crew was great and the dinner was really good!" Cons: "Breakfast could have been better and the seat was pretty uncomfortable" Pros: "Crew was average food was below average service was below par. Emirates is slipping. Boarding and deboarding was the worst." Cons: "Lots to be improved. Crew food boarding on board service." Cons: "The crew at check in was really inconsiderate and has given us false information! Despite of what documents were required and submitted I was not allowed to board the plane." Pros: "Crew was wonderful. Comfortable seat with nice meal. Overall loved it" Pros: "The crew was amazing. Food was great. Clean bathrooms. Great entertainment." Cons: "We had our passports and boarding passes checked five times in the course of 2 minutes by five different people one after the next. My cabin luggage was searched right before boarding. I appreciate the need for security, but that was excessive and unnecessary. In the peak of the Corona virus craze, the security made all passengers take off shoes and walk without any protection. This is not Qatar Airways doing - New York JFK security B S, but I am sure airways companies have some say to change it." Pros: "The check-in crew in Chicago was very nice and efficient. The flight crew on-board were not friendly, they were very curt and rushed, and did not go out of their way to be helpful." Cons: "Friendlier staff during the flight. Better food for breakfast. The connection port for my headphones did not work...I would not have been able to watch movies if I hadn't brought my own single connection head phones." Pros: "Crew did a great job keeping the long 11hour flight manageable!" Pros: "Food is delicious" Cons: "Paid WIFI this time was horrible for the half of the trip WIFI don’t work" Pros: "The aircraft was comfortable and the electronic amenities were decent and needs improvement" Cons: "Free WiFi and Dancing boys" Pros: "The crew was amazing" Cons: "The tv didn’t work throughout the whole flight. Very uncomfortable seats" Pros: "The crew provide good service but personally i did not like the food that could be lot better." Cons: "Extraordinarily care taken On board. Very impressed with Qutar Airways. Excellent" Cons: "The crew should speak up and wait for answers before moving quickly away with beverages. Seat cushions are hard and thin. movie selections are terrible and few. worst selection ever." Pros: "The whole travel experience on Asiana is great from easy check in to great onboard crew, food and service." Cons: "Nothing" Cons: "Layover in Seoul at 3.30am. Nothing is open - even the lounge does not open until 5am" Pros: "By far the best airline, service, crew, etc, I’ve ever flown with! I love Asiana Airlines!" Cons: "Seriously, nothing. It was great!" Pros: "The flight crew was great and met my expectations." Cons: "I flew on 4 separate planes and each one of them had noticeable issues with cracked interior components and torn materials. My seat was reassigned at check-in from the one I has selected 2 months earlier without notifying me. I went from a window seat to an aisle set for a 12+ hour flight." Pros: "(Business class) Friendly, helpful crew. Very good food and a pretty comfortable and adjustable seat that was great for two passengers travelling together." Cons: "In flight entertainment system was a bit outdated." Pros: "Best flight I’ve ever been on!" Cons: "It had just snowed 20” in Seattle, so we had a short delay." Pros: "I'll give a more complete and less-biased review if I get it back!" Cons: "I’m regarded as disabled, usually I have TSA pre-check privilege in most of the airline I took before but unfortunately, I couldn’t get any from Asiana. The guy helped me on checking in told me that AsIan’s didn’t provide this service to the customer. I felt not quite happy but ok with this. The one made me feel upset is they didn’t give me pre-boarding even though they already noticed that I’m disabled. I needed to wait on the line for over 25 minutes, my left leg very tired. I can walk but I can’t stand for long time, it hurts my back and leg. I got almost same style Vegetarian food in both dinner and breakfast, all vegetables, no tofu at all." Pros: "Very nice crew."
