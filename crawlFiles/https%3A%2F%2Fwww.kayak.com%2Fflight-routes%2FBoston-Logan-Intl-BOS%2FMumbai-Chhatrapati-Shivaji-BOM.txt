After boarding it was explained to me that I couldn’t move to an aisle seat even though more than one seat was available. I asked to pay or to use miles I have accrued."Read more about Emirates Cons: "I am an Emirates skywards member and I was placed in the middle seat when my preference on Emirates and Kayak is an aisle seat. After boarding it was explained to me that I couldn’t move to an aisle seat even though more than one seat was available. I asked to pay or to use miles I have accrued." Pros: "Overall good experience, could have been better if we had got seats of our choice." Cons: "If we could have got seats of our choice." Cons: "They ran out of non-vegetarian meals, which is not acceptable. The seats were rather narrow" Pros: "Staff helpful and courteous under difficult conditions." Cons: "People were allowed wheel chairs without a doctor'snote. 59 wheel chairs passengers is ridiculous. Make it a requirement wheel chair assistance required a doctor's note. And check hand luggage weight. Many bags excceeded the limit." Cons: "The airline’s insistence on keeping a passenger limited to only one carry on bag and then weighing to make sure that each carry on item was only 7 kilos was just plain ridiculous." Pros: "Punctual on Time. Clean Cabin. Nice Crew" Cons: "They should be little flexible in timing for serving Dinner, as it happened, they served Dinner as soon as the Seat belt sign was switched off, at that time it was 4 pm local time. Since we were not ready for Dinner we suggested to bring it after an hour, which they declined stating that once they take back the trays it can not be served again." Pros: "I recently booked a flight on Qatar first, to Ko Samui, Thailand. When I got on the plane, I asked the flight attendant to please be careful when he pushed the cart down the aisle because the last time I flew, the flight attendant smashed the cart into my elbow and drew blood. The flight attendant laughed at me, so I told him, calmly, that if it happened again, I would sue the airline. He didn't like that, and so for the next ten minutes he sent three different flight attendants over to ask me crazy questions like, "Do you have anything you would like to tell us?" I have no idea what this was about. Eventually, I was told to get off the plane, which ended up costing me over $1,500 in transportation, hotel, and new flight (on Emirates) fees. It was and still is a nightmare because my vacation has been ruined due to having no money. I'm a master's-degree-holding English teacher of 11 years with no history of ever having been asked to get off of a plane for any reason, and no, I was not drunk because while waiting for my luggage to be returned, had a conversation with three Boston airport police officers who did not arrest me or even understand why I had been kicked off of my flight. Nor did I speak a single profane word to the Qatar flight attendants or security, and of course, I did not use violence or resist when I was told to get off the plane. Unlike Qatar's staff, the Boston police officers were very polite and understanding. Emirates, on the other hand, was a completely different story. They were great. The staff was friendly, and when I was sleeping, they didn't send their staff over to harass me. I have flown on Emirates, Qatar, and Ethihad many times, and I truly don't understand why Qatar's staff have been instructed by their managers that it is okay to lose long-time customers and kick professional teachers off of their planes just because they think I wasn't perfectly sweet and nice to them all the time. I am an American, and in my country we have freedom of expression and speech, as long as that speech does not indicate violent intentions or use profanity or insults. Basically, I felt as though I was in a country with no rights to free speech at all. Presently I am having my lawyer work up legal documents for Qatar to get my money back and to reimburse me for travel and hotel expenses, as well as having to take two extra days off of work to reschedule my flight. I truly believe in the transparency of the travel industry through using comments like those I am making you readers aware of right now, and I assume you will benefit from this rhetorical question/advice: Emirates and Ethihad are sometimes a little more expensive than Qatar on certain flights, but is it really worth it to risk having Qatar take your money and make you miss your flight for no reason? Is it acceptable for an airline operating in the USA to deprive Americans of their right to express concern to the flight attendants on their plane?" Pros: "I enjoyed everything about Emirates. No complaints. Nice plane and stewardess." Pros: "Entertainment" Cons: "One of the flight attendants was extremely rude. She passed over me several times like I wasn't sitting in the most uncomfortable seat. In the middle. She didn't want to give me water, I had to ask if I could have some water. TSA held me up, I almost missed my flight had to be rushed on and no place to put my things so I had to sit squashed in the middle seat with all my bags for a 12 hour flight. I won't EVER go through Boston AGAIN. I won't ever chose Emirates for that long flight again, if I can help it. The WORST!!" Cons: "Overall handling of delay and missed connection flight was disappointing. The meal voucher that was given was of no use. Absolutely disappointed with the overall handling of the situation that day." Cons: "The flight was 3 hours delayed - and the captain never told us exactly what was wrong. The boarding lane was a chaos as well - and the tv screens never really worked. Terrible!" Pros: "In-flight entertainment choices." Cons: "It was a long flight, frequent offers of snacks and drinks would’ve been great." Cons: "The lounge, they use the club lounge in Boston which was so so. Could we have use the one world BA lounge instead?" Pros: "Everything" Cons: "It could be better if they serve food from Doha to Islamabad." Cons: "Qatar airways claims to have inflight wifi. But it is not true because it did not work in either of my flights. Food could have been better." Pros: "Food and entertainment was fine." Cons: "Crew was not very organized or helpful. Need more training/experience." Cons: "the area I sat in smelled weird even though the crew helped spray a solution it didn’t help the smell .. Vegetarian meal is not good" Pros: "Our flight attendants were all amazing, but especially Joanna!! She was outstanding and went above and beyond to assist us in every way possible!!" Cons: "My seats from Doha to Mumbai were very uncomfortable....37EFG. The 37D was a pain stepping out and in." Cons: "The changed the time of flight had to wait airport for 5 hrs" Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "Entertainment didn’t work, the crew did nothing to help. The plane was hot and stuffy. My luggage is lost." Pros: "The crew service was very good, as was the food. The only complain is about the entertainment, hope to update the touch screen." Cons: "I asked the Chinese flight attendant in economy to please ask the man in front of me to put his seat up since the captain and purser had already asked us to do so in three languages The man in front of me refused to do so. She said she was going to start at the front of the plane and let him leave his seat back making it difficult to see my tv monitor. I thought that she should’ve said that it was time to put your seat up. It was frustrating that she didn’t support me and the request of the captain. Your seats are very uncomfortable upright when the person in front of you has their seat back." Pros: "On time; smooth boarding process; lights dimmed for a reasonably long time." Cons: "NO legroom on the Zurich to Dusseldorf flight." Pros: "On time arrival" Cons: "Boston -Zurich, the most uncomfortable seat possible. I am 5’2 and I barely fit.... Seats are way more comfortable on European flights." Cons: "The temperature on this overnight flight was sweltering Legroom was poor" Pros: "We were pleasantly surprised at how good the food was! An added bonus was the chocolate they gave us. Crew was professional and courteous." Pros: "The staff upgraded me to business. It was a great wxperience" Pros: "There were good entertainment options though I didn’t use them" Cons: "Our flight was delayed 2.5 hours, during which we had boarded but were told we could not leave our seats even for the bathroom. We were offered a cup of water once during this delay which is inexcusable. (We were also woken up to serve dinner at 1am so that was incredibly inconvenient for an overnight flight) On top of that, I, as well as many others missed our connecting flight. Personally I missed my connection by 20 minutes, which seems a reasonable amount of time to hold a connecting flight with so many people from our flight on that next one. In missing by only 20 minutes, we have lost an entire day of our trip and are spending 9! hours in the airport today. There was no communication between flights clearly. Despite there being an earlier flight we could’ve been placed on after missing our connection - we did not get booked on this flight. I asked why and they just randomly placed people on random flights with no regard for when we showed at the desk. In this scenario, a first come first serve would have alleviated an absolutely awful experience. I will never fly Swiss Air again and will urge people I know to not fly this airline. The experience was extremely frustrating, the best response from an employee was “that’s all I can do for you” and I wish it on no one." Pros: "The planes are clean and relatively comfortable." Cons: "Extremely rigid rules. My flight was the day of the blizzard in Boston, Tues, 3/13. Despite 5 calls to Swiss to reroute me out of Montreal, an airport I could actually get to, they would not relent. I finally just drove there and a really nice agent changed my flight since Logan was closed and all public transport was shut down. Even if my scheduled flight from boston wasn't canceled (I have no idea) they were incredibly unhelpful about the fact that I physically could not get to logan in time for my flight. (Mass DOT was asking everyone to stay off ALL roads). THEN on the way home, they would NOT let me fly back to Montreal where my car was!! WAY TOO RIGID RULES. Screw the customer!" Pros: "The crew was so kind and amazing. They definitely made our flight great!" Cons: "The entertainment wasn’t working for most of the flight. We only got about an hour and a half of entertainment" Pros: "Amazing crew, excellent drinks and decent food. Very comfortable seat" Cons: "Everything was great" Pros: "Virgin Atlantic is the best airline I’ve ever flown on internationally. The service is wonderful, from check in to inflight service. Everything went as planned. The food and drinks on board are free and they are an abundance of snacks, much more than we dreamed. The flight attendants are excellent" Cons: "No. Keep up the good work!" Pros: "Premium economy was perfect, smaller cabin with less people, great flight." Pros: "Excellent airline" Cons: "The business seats could have been wider. I have sat on business class other airlines and the seat was a bit wider but overall still great experience" Pros: "Crew was great. Flight was on time and crew helped the boarding process go smoothly. It was nice to get a beer or wine at no additional cost." Cons: "Seat was shockingly small, even for economy class. TV was poor quality." Pros: "Karl was amazing! So helpful and sweet!" Cons: "Having the crew tell the guy behind me to plug in his ear phones to watch the video in his phone, rather than me after 20 minutes of noise." Pros: "crew was nice" Cons: "First time flying with a partner through Delta, so they stuck us on a Virgin Atlantic flight meaning I didn't get my free Delta check in bag (a fee of $60 each way) when I have gotten it every other flight I have ever taken with them. It was also 2 whole hours late in boarding." Pros: "The business class seats are the best we’ve had. Plenty of room, nicely laid out, good organization design. The blankets were fluffy and very comfortable. Crew was super attentive and friendly. For such a long flight, it was very pleasant, will highly recommend." Pros: "The crew were informative and friendly and attentive. We fly often and the food on this flight was the best we have had in a very long time, and we weren’t even expecting any. Thank you for a great flight Virgin ," Cons: "Long walk to the gate but no problem" Pros: "the noodle snack and food was good" Cons: "more leg room would be nice on a long flight" Pros: "Comfortable seats in Premium Economy." Cons: "Seat didn’t recline but moved to a vacant one to sleep. USB charging points didn’t charge my iPad." Pros: "Hardware was excellent. One of the most comfortable First Class seats for sure." Cons: "CX first class is designed more for individual travelers so for couples who want to sit beside one another there will be an aisle in between them. The Boston BA lounge is horrific and depressing so it should be avoided." Pros: "The crew was great. They were very quick to respond to any requests and were very accommodating." Pros: "Comfortable seat with good recline and leg room. Noise cancellation head phones are effective and comfortable. Good selection of audio and video entertainment." Pros: "the flight was on time" Cons: "the sound system on my seat was broken so I couldn't watch movies except" Pros: "The crew was average. Few of them were hospitable and friendly." Cons: "After allowing first and business class passengers if boarding is done from the tail end that makes things easier and less messy or chaotic. Many airlines does that way and it seems very much civilized approach." Pros: "We had a traumatic and abysmal experience for the trip. The flights were delayed, cancelled, wrongly rearranged and we had to run through the airports with no sleep, no food and no clear flight confirmations with minimal to no help from the Cathay Pacific staff." Cons: "Helpful ground staff with information about next flight arrangements and better telephone helpline staff." Pros: "Everything, thank you. See you next time.
