Absolutely easy travels and no cost cutting by the airline. Their snacks and hospitality was amazing. They offered full sized snacks. Im talking full sized water bottles, full sized snickers bars, gold fish, full sized canned sodas, what ever you wanted they took care of it for FREE. The crew was really nice and hospitable. I was honestly shocked Pros: "Crew took covid seriously" Cons: "The flight was empty enough for ppl to have their own rows" Pros: "Check in was great" Cons: "There was a women on the flight with a dog. She went down the isle and was letting children pet it. I felt this lwas dangerous, as you never know what a child or dog are going to do. I had a nurse sitting next to me and she said you can’t believe how many children are bit by dogs who have no history. The crew did nothing to stop this" Pros: "Amazing and friendly crew! The flight landed 30 mins early. Amazing!!!!" Pros: "The crew was very nice and great, especially since turbulence made their jobs stressful as well." Pros: "Crew was nice, food we had cookies and inflight beverages." Pros: "Always great crew with Southwest." Cons: "Honestly all planes are so cramped these days - not only SW, but I wish there was more space always." Pros: "Boarding process went very smoothly. Flight was on time when many others at the same airport were not. Capitan keep us informed well. Baggage came up very quickly in Denver." Cons: "Plane comfort was okay but should be better. Need to review newer seats." Cons: "Nothing. Smooth flight, friendly crew, and early arrival. Can’t be beat!" Pros: "As usual, the crew was very accommodating and helpful. The seat was as comfortable as possible on a plane. The second leg of the flight had a newer plane and seems to have a bit more leg room." Pros: "The seating was a lot more spacious than on the Delta flight we took to Portugal three weeks ago." Cons: "The gate agent got the boarding group messages mixed up on the display screens, which allowed some people with C boarding numbers to board with the first group of As, but aside from that minor issue everything went fine (it was a full flight, and too many people carried on luggage, as usual)." Pros: "Timing of the flight was always good. Efficient flying. Crew was super helpful too even when passengers were a bit too much." Pros: "The crew was friendly :)" Cons: "Not to the fault of our flight/crew, but our flight was delayed by about an hour due to another plane that needed mechanical attention and blocked the unloading/loading area." Pros: "Aircraft was clean and comfortable. Crew was efficient and friendly. The whole experience was excellent!" Cons: "There was lots of entertainment available but plain old music was not an option. What if I don't want to watch a movie or TV, just listen to music!" Pros: "The crew did very well. The seats could have been a little more comfortable, the lumbar could have been a bit more stiff for lower back support, the arm rest up and down function did not work, and a little more space between rows and seats would have made it more comfortable." Cons: "The seats could have been a little more comfortable, the lumbar could have been a bit more stiff for lower back support, the arm rest up and down function did not work, and a little more space between rows and seats would have made it more comfortable. The bathroom was too narrow." Pros: "The crew was nice and we enjoyed the inflight entertainment" Cons: "The flight was a hour late and we almost missed our connecting flight they actually had to hold the plane for us" Pros: "The Crew from check in to flight was amazing! Service with a Big huge smile." Cons: "Nothing to dislike." Cons: "Delayed. Flue season folks. If your sick just don’t travel!" Pros: "The seat was comfortable and the plane wasn’t over booked." Cons: "I didn’t like that we took off an hour late." Pros: "Cheap direct flight. Comfortable seats with headrests and personal TVs with great free movie selections." Cons: "Don’t forget to bring a headphone adapter for the old school jacks. (They’re supposed to have earbuds on the flight but they were sold out)" Pros: "I missed my initial flight to Portland and people with Alaska immediately booked me for the next flight out. It was incredibly reassuring to have their help and patience. Even when there was a mixup with seating, the stewardesses took care of me and made sure I had a seat. Thank you Alaska, you made it right." The pilots were awesome and got us there early. Great landing too. No complaints on the flight. Service - a young cabin crew woman was terrible as she seemed to hate her job and never smiled. Why do they hire people like that? Terrible. The cabin crew lead woman was wonderful - very professional (and more mature go figure) Pros: "It’s nice that a snack was provided. Other airlines have stopped serving snacks because of COVID-19" Cons: "Crew could have been more welcoming." Cons: "I paid extra to sit in the front of the plane and the flight attendant kept an egregiously bright LED light on that shined in my face the entire 4+ hour trip. I was really tired and extremely upset that there was no curtain or anything to stop this light from shining directly at my seat." Pros: "Crew was excellent. Boarding was great." Cons: "I had significant delays on both the flight to Logan & the flight back to Charlotte." Pros: "Tv control broken with wires coming out of the arm rest in all seats of the same row." Cons: "Three gate changes and then delays of ramp connecting to plane. It was ok" Cons: "Left 5 hours late. Not notified til I left for airport. Sat on the plane almost 90 minutes before we took off. Flight was good" Pros: "Crew was courteous and gave constant updates in regards to any delays." Cons: "Flight was delayed and there was congestion prior to take off. Not sure there was anything that could’ve been done." Pros: "Crew was nice and accommodating. Plenty of leg room in regular cabin. Good entertainment options.?" Cons: "The flight was delayed for quite awhile. I had been traveling all day and I just wanted to go home. We also were not informed why it was delayed for so long." Pros: "Delta is doing a great job keeping everything calm and clean during this pandemic!" Pros: "Kosher snacks! Thank you. Screens and outlets at every seat. Safe, controlled Covid protocols including de-boarding. Excellent!" Pros: "Delta flight took extra precaution to keep all passengers safe before during and after the flight. They communicate effectively during the flight. I will be flying Delta again and again." Cons: "The trip was great" Cons: "Wouldn’t change a thing! I don’t always fly! But when I do!! I fly delta!!" Pros: "The crew was great. The pilots too." Cons: "The audio and video at my seat did not work correctly." Pros: "Boarding process need to be improved. Seat assignment is horrible" Pros: "The staff at Delta are always friendly and helpful and they were able to squeeze me onto a very full flight." Cons: "Nothing, really. Airlines unfortunately can’t make people patient or polite, & I can’t afford a private jet, so I’ll have to settle for an eye roll or twelve." Pros: "I always have a consistently good experience on Delta. Everything was great." Cons: "It was a Great flight.
