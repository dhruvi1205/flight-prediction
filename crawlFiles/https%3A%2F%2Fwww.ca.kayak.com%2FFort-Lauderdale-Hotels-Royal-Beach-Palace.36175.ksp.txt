Dmitrii the bar tender was amazing with great service and bar tricks. So much fun Cons:Nothing the hotel can help but the street out front very busy and loud. Lots of cars showing off. A 2.0 Poor Anonymous, Dec. 2017 Pros:Not really anything Cons:Very dirty room. Dust and mold growing from the air conditioner vents, dust literally all over the room, mold growing on walls right by our heads on the bed, sticky bathroom, dead bugs all over, mold smell, stained blood/brown stuff on sheets. Disgusting hotel. never would recommend. Will warn everyone I know not to go here. A 5.1 Fair Anonymous, Nov. 2017 Pros:The housekeeping staff works hard to keep this place clean. Cons:The front desk people seemed to be in chaos all the time. It’s an old hotel on a very busy street, so bring earplugs to sleep at night. The air conditioning needs repair. Let's say this, you get what you pay for. N 8.0 Very good Nestor, Nov. 2017 Pros:Look of the place you can tell they've spent some money on remodeling so the place looks good. Cons:Parking was very limited, no breakfast included, internet was very poor unacceptable and unusable to do any real work we had to go to the Dunkin donuts down the street. A 6.0 Okay Anonymous, Aug. 2017 Cons:Property ran out of room type that was reserved. Multiple buildings that are not connected, required walking in rain to and from lobby.
