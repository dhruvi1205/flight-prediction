There were roaches in the bathroom. The carpet in the room just looks gross. It was a very uncomfortable stay. This is an old hotel than had an old motel feeling to it. The location was everything. It was very convenient to where I was going on International drive. D 8.0 Very good David, Oct. 2022 The room was comfortable. S 8.2 Very good Sidney, Aug. 2019 Pros:The cleanliness of the rooms and comfy pillows Cons:Check in and check out was very unsatisfactorily A 9.7 Wonderful Anonymous, Mar. 2019 Pros:Location Cons:Security in the parking lots. A 9.4 Wonderful Anthony, Jan. 2019 Pros:Great location to the fun of I-Drive and Universal. Efficient, affordable! Its skeleton is a classic 20th century motel with the outdoor walkways which gives it some character, but they've been updated well (albeit with stucco walls). Absolutely comfortable and efficient. Cons:I had a used towel left on my dresser, but it may have been used by housecleaning to wipe things down (I hope). A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Dec. 2018 Pros:Went for a conference, the hotel is within walking distance of the West convention center at less than half the price of the girls which are connected to the center. Comfortable, clean and felt staff. Cons:No complaints, great value. S 8.5 Very good Sandra, Nov. 2018 Pros:The staff was very nice and everything was convenient. Having a deli open 24 hours and the breakfast buffet was great. Cons:The room was a bit stuffy. My allergies kicked it and woke up feeling a little sick. Air filter needs to be cleaned. A 8.8 Very good Anonymous, May 2018 Pros:The check in process was easy enough. The room exceeded the expectation that I had for the price I paid. Very beautiful and safe. I will be returning in a month during my next visit. Cons:Can’t really think of any A 6.0 Okay Anonymous, May 2018 Pros:Location Cons:Maid knocking on room at 9am each morning to do the room. We just had a big smile on her face when I advised her we were not checking out that day and had a longer reservation. Limited towels and toiletries and not as clean as it used to be. S 10.0 Wonderful Sergio, Apr. 2018 Pros:They attended to me in a timely manner. Check-in was very smooth..
