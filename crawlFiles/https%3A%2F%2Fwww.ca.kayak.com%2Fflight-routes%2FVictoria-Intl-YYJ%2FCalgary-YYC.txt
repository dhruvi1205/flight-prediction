Pleasant attendants, timely luggage to carousels.Read more about Air North Service was great from start to finish. Pleasant attendants, timely luggage to carousels. This airline is never a disappointment. Always on time. Short haul from YLW to YYZ , best way to travel. Boarding was fine, and flight was on time. During the flight however, you aren't even offered a drink of water. The carts never leave the galleys. All the attendants said the whole time is take your headphones off and buckle your seatbelt. For the price I wouldn't expect 5 star service, but maybe a drink would have been acceptable Nothing needs to change as it is such a short flight. The employees at the counter when we first arrived were very helpful and kind. The flight attendants were are very pleasant and helpful. I appreciated we departed on time. Pros: "Price was the best over competitors. Many dates available. Staff are friendly and service oriented. Coffee is so good. Food is great. Flight was on time." Cons: "I booked online and then had to rebook - by calling the call centre. Be good to have the ability to change flights online as well. Call centre staff was good - except I assumed she’d book us sitting in the same seats as I had originally chosen (which were available - as I checked online)." Pros: "Service was good, frequent drinks and snacks, nice little deli platter was unexpected and very delicious!" Pros: "You constantly got food and drinks served, a big contrast to the other airlines who don't even serve complimentary food on 5 hour trips. We didn't expect to get food on this 2 hour flight so we had breakfast beforehand. We were pleasantly surprised!" Pros: "Friendly staff. Provided sandwich and cookie during flight." Cons: "Minor item: Didn't provide hav charger in seats but for short flights not a big issue" Pros: "From the coffee and cookies while waiting to board to the freshly baked items given while receiving food service, this is great customer service. Not to mention the competitively priced airfare and not having to pay an extra fee for checked bags, this airline can't be beat. I would definitely fly it again and suggest it to anyone if they're looking to fly in northern Canada." In- flight crew was upbeat and helpful. Fluid boarding. Food options for purchase ran low on healthy options half way through cabin. Mr Noodles soup is a very low end option. There's far better brands available on the market ie : Nongshim soon veggie and Nongshim Shin Black beef broth. As a diabetic; I would have ordered cheese and crackers but were sold out before row 20. Pros: "The stewardess accidentally spilled a little water on me but she was so nice about it and apologetic that she paid for my drink. Good people skills in bad situations make a huge difference." Pros: "Crew and staff at gate fantastic. Accommodated me sitting with partner on both legs (booked flights separately)." Cons: "Flight was delayed. Always tough late at night." Cons: "Communication from you all. I missed my flight because of the terrible instructions and communication" Cons: "After landing, we were waiting on the tarmac for sometime and I needed to use the restroom I was an allowed to do so. It would’ve taken me a short short time. I went to The rear of the plane to use the restroom and was told to get in my seat." Pros: "Always a pleasure when flying with Westjet. Crew is always better than Air Canada" Cons: "Update the seats please. They are so old and there was no cushion" Cons: "Our trip got completely rerouted - we are still in Edmonton and expected to be with family in Regina a couple of hours ago. :(((" Pros: "Newest 787 plane in the fleet. Really comfortable seats and terrific in-flight entertainment" Pros: "Nice plane, comfortable" Cons: "We missed our runway and had to quickly ascend and retry. Disembarking the plane took 40 minutes due to the YYC skywalk being frozen. During this all communication with the passengers was minimal." Pros: "Boarding smooth and quick, up up and away, watched TV for the whole trip, smooth landing and 15 minutes ahead of the time." It was delayed and I could not make it to my connecting flight Air Canada has really gone the extra mile to start winning customers back. The cost of the flight (using Aeroplan points and eUpgrades) was by far the winning ticket. However, everything about the flight was smooth. There was a 30-minute delay departing Calgary but we made that up in actual flight time. The flight attendants couldn't have been more helpful. A wonderful experience! Pros: "Crew as always with air Canada were very accommodating. Always smiling!" Pros: "Excellent pods on business and very good food and service" Cons: "Food is tasteless and it is too crapped. No leg room on planes" Pros: "The staff was very congenial and helpful. Sense of humour too!" Pros: "movies" Cons: "Since my flight was delayed from calgary I had to sleep overnight to catch a morning flight. To my inconvenience I had to wait to have my seat assigned at the gate. I asked the rep at the gate to please have an aisle seat but she asked me to wait as she will call my name for seat assignments later. As I waited like she called many names and not mine, i again reminded her that she didnt call mine and she then just gave me my boarding pass without even apologizing that shr had put me in a middle seat. I told her i cant sit im a middle seat i need am aisle because I go to the bathroom often. she coldly said. "no more aisle seats". bad experience with ground staff in general as this is not the first time." Pros: "The whole experience from boarding to landing was great. Zone 2 boarding is one of the first called and the premium economy section has larger seats that recline more and don't affect the person behind as much. Food was decent and serve on a ceramic plate with real silver wear. On demand entertainment was adequate with a number of recent titles and even audiobook options." Cons: "The section was set up in a 2-3-2 seat configuration and I booked the middle 3, but were given 2 in the middle and one one the left aisle. One of the middle seats was left open for the pilot to come back and watch movies during the flight. When I asked the attendant if we could swap the left aisle with the "pilot's" the attendant made it seem like it was a bigger deal but eventually asked the pilot who said he didn't mind. After all, it was just changing one empty seat to the other side of the aisle." Pros: "Calgary air port was very beautiful. I did enjoy movies." Pros: "I flew roundtrip to Japan on Air Canada business class. Buying a ticket late, I noticed it was only $500 or so more for business class. We did have to touchdown in Canada coming and going, but short and efficient hops. On the way back, it probably saved time because we were cleared in Canada so arriving back in Philly was like a domestic flight. Great Food and service. The trip to Japan on their new Dreamliner business class featured an amazingly designed pod - super comfortable, lay flat for sleeping, But has good layout and table space if I had wanted to work on laptop. Thumbs up!" Flight delayed by 4 hours but no communication. With passengers until after the posted departure time became apparent the flight was not going to board even close to on time. Flight was sent canceled. The absolute most useless staff I have ever witnessed. Utterly careless - literally could not care less. 100% never using this airline again. Poor communication at the check in counter and boarding gates. Other then the screaming baby the flight was fine, nothing special Check in experience was smooth, and the flight attendants were courteous and friendly. Very positive experience overall, thank you all! Flight arrived late but other than that everything else okay Great price for a new plane. Only offered water which we knew.
