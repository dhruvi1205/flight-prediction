They lost our luggage. We missed our connection from YVR to Naples when we arrived in Zurich and then we got re-routed to Rome and then Naples. We eventually got to Naples but our bags didn’t. Our experience at the lost luggage in the Naples was not at all reassuring. They didn’t seem that interested in our problem. I did a live chat with Swiss customer service and all they could do is tell me to follow the process. Meanwhile we’ve had to spend significant money on clothes and I have to replace medications. This has meant our trip so far has been totally different than what we had planned. It’s not clear that our baggage will ever show up which means we will have lost significant amount of clothing and other things and our two month trip to Europe will have more problems than good memories.

So far we are not happy. Cons: "I fell sick and my doctor advised against flying. Tried calling Swiss Air and JustFly.com: 6 calls back and forth and 7 hours on hold, no help. Finally got advised on driving to the airport to make the flight change at the Swiss Air counter at O’Hare. The representative told me to bring a note from doctor to switch flights. I did the next day. The same representative looked me in the eye after advising the day before and said there’s nothing she could do. Why make an elderly sick person drive to the airport again if you know already you cannot help??Absolutely terrible experience, no help from the airline or travel agency. Total loss of the full price of the ticket." Pros: "Entertainment" Cons: "I requested a vegan vegetarian meal and did not get it. I had to do with the regular meal which had a lot of dairy products to which I am allergic to. The space between rows of seats. It was really crammed in Economy and we are a petite thin family!" Pros: "The crew was very nice." Cons: "The seats had such little cushion that it made the flight extremely uncomfortable." Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "Entertainment didn’t work, the crew did nothing to help. The plane was hot and stuffy. My luggage is lost." Pros: "The crew service was very good, as was the food. The only complain is about the entertainment, hope to update the touch screen." Pros: "Amazing - they had a full dinner for a 9:55pm flight, with real silverware, complementary alcohol, for economy passengers! Crew extremely professional and efficient." Cons: "We were packed like sardines! My flight made me want to retire from traveling!" Pros: "Movies" Cons: "Crew was rude to passengers. One passenger asked for extra bread and crew arrogantly commented , we dont give but ok take one." Pros: "The crew was really great and helpful" Cons: "Only thing that could have been better was ginger ale." Upon landing our breakfast were left, which means all the tray tables were were down for on landing . Isn’t there an FAA have rule about that Crew was great. Food and entertainment was great. There was plenty of leg room sitting in a economy seat. That being said put thicker padding at the lower part of the seat. The person seated behind me was very tall and their knees were pushed into my back the entire flight. I understand having to move your legs but it was moving into my back for a 9 hour flight! Cons: "Given we left at 7:15 am, I would’ve liked some food options instead of biscuits and peanuts" Pros: "Kosher snacks! Thank you. Screens and outlets at every seat. Safe, controlled Covid protocols including de-boarding. Excellent!" Pros: "Delta flight took extra precaution to keep all passengers safe before during and after the flight. They communicate effectively during the flight. I will be flying Delta again and again." Cons: "The trip was great" Cons: "We arrived around 39 minutes early and the whole process was very smooth" Pros: "The crew was great. The pilots too." Cons: "The audio and video at my seat did not work correctly." Pros: "Flight was on time and crew helped find a place for my violin. Even though I was early to the gate, they also helped me update my seat before the new flight crew arrived." Cons: "Flight was freezing. Crew was overly concerned about my tree nut allergy. Been flying for 40+ years and this was the first time any one has asked...appreciate it but they went overboard" Cons: "Nothing, really. Airlines unfortunately can’t make people patient or polite, & I can’t afford a private jet, so I’ll have to settle for an eye roll or twelve." Cons: "everything sucked time bery bad servive starfed on flight nonacolok was sergvedngypu ilt was really disappoinyling includigbymkthrvlounhr aothee airlione" Pros: "Specially food service and also boarding" Cons: "They checked carry on again even you passed from the counter I felt very bad about this" Pros: "Food was tolerable. Good cabin temperature. Good lumbar support and pillow." Cons: "Horrible leg space on the first leg of the journey. Air hostess we'e very inattentive. Asked for a blanket 3 times and still didn't get it. Also they had a poor attitude. Power outlets don't work on multiple seats. Oh and again no leg room. Zilch." Pros: "The little details...slippers, nice meal, foot rests, deep carryon bins." Cons: "Legroom, too tight. Attendants blocking lane unable to reach restroom, entertainment didnt work." Pros: "Lots of entertainment on the plane. Very clean. I like the personal touch of a travel Bag given and large head phones." Pros: "The staff is very accommodating and the meals served on board were good." Pros: "good people /service, good food and comfortable seating nice experience all in all" Cons: "Plane delayed by 3 hours. Missed my other flight to Tirana. Horrible service at the airport to help me out with a hotel. Had to run around for over 3 hours. Never flying Turkish again." Pros: "The service was very nice and courteous" Cons: "The seats don’t match up to the comfort level and privacy of the other airlines" Pros: "Turkish Airlines offers an experience much better than your average two-hour plane hop in the U.S. There was a full meal served, staff were kind and didn’t try to sell a bunch of extra stuff to you, and there were many choices for in-flight entertainment." Cons: "Unfortunately, the children on the plane were really poorly behaved and loud. In addition, the flight was delayed by 1 full hour and when we arrived in Vienna our luggage (and the luggage of many other passengers) had not been sent with us. We waited in line for luggage for 30 minutes, then another line for at least 30 more minutes to report the missing bag, and we were then told that it wouldn’t arrive for another day and would be delivered to us within a 3 hour window in the middle of the day. This was essentially an entire night and day lost to a mishap that the airline didn’t even notify us of when we landed. Pretty frustrating." I travel frequently. The flight was late again... KLM should really try and be on time The plane was clean and the staff was friendly. Food and drinks as expected on international flights. The entertainment system was old style, with a pullout controller, and selections not as extensive as on other flights. Amazing KLM service and brilliant economy comfort seats. Well worth the extra. The boarding was one of the worst I’ve ever experienced. The fault lays on Ohare Airport and not so much the airline. The waiting area by the gate was the size to accommodate a regional flight for 20-30 people and right next to a busy walkway. When you cramped nearly 300 passengers into that space is was unbearable. All and all pretty good. It’s crowded but that is what flying is all about. But no complaints otherwise. At the transit could be less time not like 12 hour 6 hours the mix should be 4 hour, thanks Boarding in NCL is really bad. I'm sure part of that is a directive from the airport that KLM can't change but part of that is due to KLM policy. NCL doesn't announce the gate of departure until 30 minutes before departure. However, when you arrive at the gate area, the gate agents file everyone into one long line and everyone boards from one line at one time. This line can stretch for 200m...easily. There is a separate line for groups 1 and 2 but you don't know it until you get to the gate area and agents don't announce/advertise it. Everyone else is grouped into one line. Are you in group 3? Doesn't matter...you board with group 5. Traveling with a child? Tough luck...you're stuck at the end of the line and board last. The last part is very annoying because none of the gates at NCL (with the exception of 1 used by Emirates) has a jetway. To board, you must leave the gate area, walk downstairs, walk onto the tarmac and walk up stairs to board the plane. Highly challenging if you're traveling with small children. That boarding process begs for a concession to allow people with children to board first because they will need extra time. But there is no such policy. Just a really horrible boarding experience all around. Pros: "Crew was great, on time flight, clean plane." Cons: "Entertainments options were shockingly few. Honestly have not been on a plane recently with so few and limited options of TV series and movies. I was extremely surprised. Wish I had know and I would’ve had more options for my family." Pros: "Friendly crew, great access to a variety refreshments, robust entertainment library." Cons: "No suggestions." Pros: "I liked how generous they were with food and drinks" Cons: "Free WiFi could have made the flight a lot better" The restrictions regarding carry-on baggage is too strict. My wife was forced to check her carry-on bag. Never had this on other airlines. Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "Flight delayed for one hour which caused us to miss our train. We had the longest check-in queue in the world although we have already checked in online and had our boarding passes in advance. Snack on board was a poor piece of biscuits" Pros: "Seat was very comfortable and lots of leg room. Food was good." Cons: "Seat spacing is small, to the point that it's impossible to remain in the seat few hours without physical pain in your body" Pros: "entrance with classical music! staff was friendly. probably in top 5 flights" Cons: "nothing" Pros: "Plane was clean. Staff helpful" Cons: "We booked our seats online and later at check in received boarding passes with totally different seats. Ordered kids meals and was informed that they dont have any for our kids :(" Cons: "The crew kept the temperature in cabin at 26 or 28 degrees Celsius. Whole trip felt like being in the oven. I will NEVER EVER FLY AUSTRIAN AIRLINES AGAIN." Pros: "Crew was fantastic and with an exceptional service. Food was really good." Cons: "Maybe the seats coudl be a little bit wider" Pros: "Very efficient and fuss free. Just what I was looking for from a short haul flight!" Cons: "The snacks are super small, which isn’t unexpected when the flight time is so short." Cons: "The Austrian airlines website is absolutely the worst and least user friendly that I've seen for an airline. I tried paying for my bags and it rejected half of the itinerary's bookings for no reason. It took a ton of clicks to get stuff done and I kept getting errors. Very limited movie selection."
