Called SWISS customer service on a Russian line, were told to get a paper from another Russian airport that no flights were leaving the city. Did that. when arrived to Moscow no SWISS customer representatives were at the stations and had to end up buying a completely new ticket to get home."

Called SWISS customer service on a Russian line, were told to get a paper from another Russian airport that no flights were leaving the city. Did that. when arrived to Moscow no SWISS customer representatives were at the stations and had to end up buying a completely new ticket to get home." Cons: "Have customer service representative available at the airport 24/7 knowing that some people arrive from all parts of the country." Pros: "Good AC - very important, calm and nice atmosphere. Very friendly staff." Pros: "The crew was quite pleasant and friendly - very accomodating" Cons: "Entertainment system is outdated, the food was only passable. The chocolate was nice" Pros: "The seat was much better than other airlines' economy seats. Great food and lots of it. Excellent attendants. Zurich is the best planned airport for changing to next flight. I'm going to try to use Swiss as often as I can." Cons: "Free Wifi." Pros: "Lots of room on the flight, fresh warm bread, lots of water, nice cabin crew" Cons: "How do I book a vegetarian meal??" Pros: "The food was decent and on board entertainment was pretty good." Cons: "The boarding experience was terrible. We bought new lightweight International sized carry-on bags for our family of four and packed extremely light to keep each of bags under the 8 kg weight limit for carry-on bags. The crew required us to check them anyway! So incredibly annoying." Pros: "The crew was professional and helpful. The flight attendant was especially kind to the children giving them activities and toys to play with. The seats were spacious and comfortable. The food was good." Cons: "It’s a small thing, but it’d be nice to have more variety of movies to choose from." Pros: "Crew was very attentive, information from the cockpit was enough to let us know but not disruptive" Cons: "Boarding was one long line that other passengers in the airport had to walk through. This was difficult for passengers with kids and those with needed special accommodations Ike wheelchairs, canes etc" Pros: "Really good flight. Clean,on time, efficient. Early arrival even" Cons: "Placed in back row. Ran out of food choices twice!!! Requested they start serving from the back after the first shortage. Told that was not the procedure. The Swiss need to apply customer care to all in the same class equally." Pros: "Efficient check in. Liked the shuttle bus service from subway to airport." Cons: "As expected this is a commuter flight so very stripped down in terms of amenities. Tight plane seating and those overhead bins just barely accommodate the carry on." Pros: "The crew was good and boarding was super efficient" Cons: "No entertain on the plane. Since when YTZ offered no more complimentary drinks and some snack?" Pros: "Very convenient, non stops and airport is close to downtown" Cons: "Captain said the 1 hour delay was due to bad weather in Washington DC but there was no bad weather in DC. He should have said the truth. I was in flight 729 from Toronto to Washington Dulles airport on 7/7." Cons: "The 4pm flight not leaving at 10pm. Or at least being informed that the flight was gonna be delayed before 3 pm" Cons: "I was required to pay for my carryon, which I was never informed during my booking." Pros: "I felt like I was taken advantage of by porter airlines" Cons: "They didn’t tell me I had to pay 110$ to bring on carry on luggage! Unacceptable. I will never fly porter again." Pros: "Porter airlines is efficient and the customer service is the best I have experienced." Cons: "I miss the free amenities that they used to offer at the Billy Bishop airport, but the newly renovated airport is nice!" Cons: "Our checked in bags did not come out on the carousel, instead they had been sitting on the ground beside another carousel - with no notification. There was a handful of us waiting 30+ mins for our bags and no one around to assist." Pros: "n/A" Cons: "Was not offered a flight back to Ottawa, had to find a ride from Toronto to Ottawa once we landed .6 hours driving. See above." Pros: "The seats were comfortable and even roomy, compared to many other airlines." Cons: "Two minor drawbacks: (1) In the Porter lounge, where I was stuck between connecting flights, the cost of food was too high. (2) The weather buffets these small planes more than would be the case with jetliners." Pros: "Yes for thé seat" Cons: "Bene avisé for thé Velay and ont at thé airport 6hrs lost" Cons: "Small seat, no entertainment, you have to buy blanket and headphones" Cons: "Crew in London that checks our boarding pass and passports to let us on the plane was quite rude to my family. Crew inside the plane was great!" Pros: "getting off flight they didn't tell me at gate checkin that I needed a specific tag to receive my double stroller at the gate upon arrival to yyz. so I arrived with my twins and all our stuff to have to carry one of them and deal with all kinds of trouble until we wereat luggage pickup. HORRIBLE" Cons: "when gate checking strollers be more clear - I was travelling alone with twin 4 year olds ... to have to carry all the carry on luggage and deal with kids who are tired having the stroller after the flight at the gate would have been extra helpful which w=is what I had intended" Pros: "L’équipage très serviable à l’ecoute et souriant" Cons: "Pas d’ecran dans les appuie tête devant pour l’entertainment. Le siege n’a aucun ajustement pour la tête Et aucune prise usb pour charger nos appareils" Cons: "Better notification that I was going to be charged £50 for each piece of luggage" Cons: "Flught was 90 mins late leaving becuse of equipment failure. Missed my meeting." Pros: "Seats had decent space." Cons: "Only had limited food so when the staff came, they had nothing left except for junk. Pretty pathetic considering we have to pay for it too. They prefer to let their passengers starve. No entertainment. Wouldn't take air Transat again unless I had no choice." Pros: "Hassle free and easy. Since our airport arrival was ddlayed by rush hour traffic, the check jn process was made easier by the Air Transit attendant's assistance to be processed through fast track security clearance." Cons: "The Food and Entertainment raiting above should be understood as Not Applicapble" Cons: "I did not like that economy pax are limited to 1 checked in luggag. I think 2 in more ideal especially for an international flight." very late flight, small uncomfortable seats. no refreshments except small plastic cups of juice or water, no snacks, no food given, no earphones given unless you pay.who has earphones with jacks anymore? what good are those except for your plane? Delay, delay, delay. Boarding was extremely slow. Put everyone on buses to get to the plane and then made us wait - 15 after we just boarded and then 15 minutes at the plane while they finished some engine maintenance (we all just watched the crew fix some things!!) and while they cleaned the plane. And then they bused us to the terminal when we landed in Casablanca. Flown to Casablanca several times in the last year and this was the first time I had to be bused to the terminal. TAP has an on-time departure rate of 56% in 2022, and this flight added to that abysmal score. Everything was efficient and comfortable. The food was typical airline fair, and steamed into oblivion. Service was prompt and friendly My flights were cancelled and rescheduled. My wife and I ended up not being seated together and on the return flight ANA lost the reservation, and we were once again not seated together, in middle seats. It was horrific. flight was cancelled at an hour's notice- it appears that when flights are not full, customers are left to fend for themselves. I missed my one and only conference in 6 years, and the 900$ charge was not refundable. Our first flight was delayed 2 hours and then just 5 minutes after landing, we find out our connecting flight was canceled. They almost lost our luggage but fortunately a crew member by the name of Abu was pur savior and found it. Unfortunately, that ordeal took us almost 2 hrs and we couldn't be accommodated on another flight, forcing us to stay in Montreal for 3 days, paying only for one night at a hotel and some voucher for food only valid at the airport. Total BS. They said to save the receipts of any expense we incur to submit them for refund oj their website. But, who know how long will take them to pay us back so.. yeah good job Air Canda. 👎👎 TV did not work, flight was delayed 3.5 hours, and the flight crew was unapologetic about the delay. We finally left the ground at 2:30am after sitting on the tarmac for an hour after pushing away from the gate We had a connecting international flight in Toronto when we landed found out that one of our assigned seats was now on standby. Two hour line at customer service on telephone hold for over an hour without answer. The plane was very old and outdated many thing did not function properly. Business class had half the normal bin space of a modern plane by the time we boarded the only bin space available was filled with bedding and pillows for a return flight I must assume. Half of the chair functions did not work. The food was by far the worst I have been offered in forty years of flying. We tried to refund our return flights from Lisbon Portugal to Los Angeles and were offered $122 on $7000 tickets. Air Canada is by for my worst experience in international air travel I have had to date and I am dreading the trip home. Oh Air Canada may we never meet again. It was actually from TORONTO to Lisbon. Very comfortable food and drinks were great as were the crew Air Canada is fine, right up until the point you have any sort of problem. In my case, they lost my luggage and communicated about it poorly. There’s no one working the baggage office, and the one employee I managed to find didn’t know how to operate their system. The tracking app they refer you to doesn’t work, and their customer service is impossible to reach.
