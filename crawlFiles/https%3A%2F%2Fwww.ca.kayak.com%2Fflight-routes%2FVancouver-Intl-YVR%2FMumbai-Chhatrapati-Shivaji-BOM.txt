Pros: "Food" Cons: "We both - Wife and me - had to pay around 200 USD for TWO Extra Suitcases in spite of both being an ANA Flying Miles Members. Hence What is the uet of these ANA Miles Club (AMC) Membership? Remains an EYE-WASH................................." Everything was fantastic! The crew really went above and beyond to make it a great flight. I felt cared for with EVA. Flight crew was the best. First time on Eva airways and we will be a repeat customer. Service was efficient and food was very good. Empty seats allowed us to stretch and sleep. Pros: "Crew was very friendly. Flight was on time. Meals were good. Will be flying with EVA again" Pros: "Crew Food Speed of boarding and unboarding" Cons: "2 seat rows. 3rd passenger frequently needed leave his seat and he smelled" Pros: "Service overall excellent.

Plus we were over an hour late once we finally got off the plane" Pros: "Great food, and lots of leg room in economy. The flights were on time." Pros: "This is a bit weird, but it was the first time I flew Eva economy. I've taken this route many times in business and it would take pages to go through all the things that EVA does right in business class. So I was stunned when my first time in economy was so incredibly impressive as well." Cons: "I'm really picky and there's nothing more I could have wanted in an economy flight experience." Pros: "1. Kind and accommodating flight attendants 2. Had a good variety of choices for food & drinks 3. I was lucky enough to be on a roomy flight 4. Bathrooms were clean and smelled nice 5. The provided earbuds/earphones are great since they provide a bit of noise cancelling or at least block out extra noise" Pros: "They have a good number of movie and music selections. I got plenty of rest throughout the flight and barely felt the travel time. The seats were comfortable." My Tv don’t work the whole from Doha to New Delhi. Overnight didn’t work from Bos to Doha and had to eat food without light Qatar said few times that the luggage will be at the final destination but they were wrong. Please check where your port of entry is at the destination. This is where the luggage would be. The food was terrible. I lost my baggage and it’s been three days didn’t able to find out. Also ticket was issued for qatar airways but they ended up board me on to Indigo from Doha to Hyderabad. My trip made miserable without cloths. Plane was clean, bathrooms were clean. Staff were very polite. Coming from Air India it was a welcome change. We were stranded in bus for 10 min waiting for baording..Specially when you are traveling with kids and long previous flight. Flight has no information regarding time to destination. Wish to have screen for international travels. Cons: "We’ve been waiting for almost an hour now for the bags to come out. This is insane" Cons: "Under 2 babies did not get enough milk They should have baby food items cereals, crackers or baby foods options" Pros: "crew was nice and helpful" Cons: "food quality needs to be better food quantity needs to be increased slightly food options need to be better entertainment system was ok but content was mediocre." Pros: "Food and entertainment was fine." Cons: "Crew was not very organized or helpful. Need more training/experience." Pros: "The crew was very sweet and very helpful, especially to kids who were constantly thirsty or hungry." Cons: "We were supposed to take the flight 8 hours earlier. I’m not sure flight with such short connections should be sold at all - with the previous flight being late 20 minutes, we were met at arrival gate by Qatar airlines employee that told us our connecting flight left without us. They helped us with everything onward- getting new boarding passses, hotel and meal vouchers, but all of this should not have been needed if such short connections were not sold." Not exceptional but all good. Business class seats are like the domestic Mint class on Jet Blue. Comfortable but not exceptional. Food is good but not superb. Flight attendants were better on India leg than Miami to Zurich. All India staff was more professional and service oriented. Very polite and service with a smile. We so appreciated that our connecting flight waited for 6 of us!!! Cons: "Food was served warm. Perhaps the menu could be better, but it wasn’t bad." Pros: "Lots of room on the flight, fresh warm bread, lots of water, nice cabin crew" Cons: "How do I book a vegetarian meal??" Cons: "Legspace in economy class was probably good back in 1975, but in 2019 not acceptable anymore" Pros: "Check in agent was extremely helpful in expediting both me and my bags after a late check-in. Flight attendants very friendly and helpful, food excellent. If Swiss Air flew everywhere I need to go, I would fly them every time!" Pros: "Enjoyed the surprisingly good vegetarian hot meal, wine, and chocolate! (And silverware) Said to us they cared for passengers and the environment. A much better overall experience than with United!" Cons: "Plane did not have a place to switch to the other aisle without disturbing passengers or crew! You need to move a tad bit on such a long flight!" Pros: "Quick passport control Friendly staff Short waiting time to board" Pros: "friendly ,respectful, helpful,informative" Cons: "the very long layovers.i did not enjoy complications to find a place to rest between long flights." Pros: "Since the flight from Palermo was 1hr. late. Swiss air took us privately to check our passports and directly into the plane. That was Excellent Or we would have missed our flight. We made it into the plane, too bad our luggage din`t." Cons: "Not enough room between seats for international flight." Pros: "Entertainment system is nice with recent movies and many other selections." Cons: "I found my pillowcase has a long human hair. And noticed the same in the other pillows around my seat.
