Pros: "Seat was uncomfortable because of the head rest that is attached to the seat. However the staff and crew were friendly and helpful." Cons: "Better seats" Pros: "Newest 787 plane in the fleet. Really comfortable seats and terrific in-flight entertainment" Pros: "Crew were very friendly and were having a good time during the flight, which was nice to see." Cons: "No pillows or blankets supplied, luckily I had my own otherwise I would have been miserable. Worst surprise was that there was no food provided. On a long haul flight that was surprising, they should clearly say that on booking. There were snacks available for purchase, but not great." Cons: "Total rip off. I won't be flying West Jet again if it can be avoided" Pros: "Yes, the crew was very good." Cons: "It would have been nice to have coffee on the flight. All they had to offer was a snack and a glass of water." Pros: "Friendly crew" Cons: "That westjet q400 is an awful aircraft with terrible slimline seats" Pros: "Staff is friendly." Cons: "We didn’t appreciate the walk from Gate 4 to Gate 41 TWICE when the departure gate was changed. We are in our 80’s and it was quite a trek!" Pros: "counter staff were friendly, courteous. helpful. Flight staff were friendly." Cons: "prop- jet was loud & bumpy while on the ground at takeoff" Pros: "Flight crew remained jovial and pleasant despite the many issues." Cons: "Mis messaging and changing/non factual information as the flight status changed. I had personal issues ongoing which resulted in a flight change, and having to go back to security multiple times, which would have all been easier if I had been told that I didn't have to run like a mad woman through the airport as the flight was already determined to be significantly delayed. West Jet tried......they just don't see to be able to know anything." I had checked in online the day before but was instructed to collect our boarding passes when we arrived. I am not completely comfortable using the automated Kiosks and always enjoy the nostalgia of speaking with someone when checking in for a flight. Upon doing so however, we were immediately asked,"did you check in online already?" To which I replied, "yes, but we were asked to retrieve our boarding passes upon arrival." She then said, "that's what those machines over there are for. We really encourage people to use those." That unfortunately sparked a series of shortness and overall poor behavior in my opinion from the woman who checked us in. I understand it was early in the morning but I am always excited to experience flying and that interaction has unfortunately left a bitter taste in my mouth to the point I will forever now hesitate to book with Porter again. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Cheers, JD Everything was fantastic, by far the best airline experience in Canada 🇨🇦! Unlike our porter connection this was great , smooth 2minutes at check in not 90 mins Food wasn’t great but it’s plane food , staff were great I can't praise the crew enough on how fantastic they where West Jet could learn alot from Porter about customer satisfaction travelling in 14th of April and now we are in 17th , I have not received my lost/delayed bag... this is very bad and the worst part is their call center is not able to see where is it!!!! Porter is the airline that does care. All trips with Porter have been smooth and relaxing. The extras are the customer appreciation. The others just don’t do that. Cons: "Honestly, even if the aircraft was delayed, there is nothing one can do and just be patient. Lunch and dinner vouchers were issued, that was well appreciated!" Cons: "We were delayed leaving Quebec for the aircraft weight being to heavy and Porter had oversold the flight. They had to burn fuel from the plane while on the tarmac For awhile to make the weight restrictions. The flight was nearly 90 minutes late taking off, Once in the air the flight was nice." Pros: "Bunch of crooks gave me the wrong time. Missed my flight" Cons: "Getting correct to information" Pros: "Cheap price of the airline ticket." Cons: "I was booked where someone was already sitting. It was difficult because I was with my two young children. And someone else was booked in my child's seat also." The flight was on time, staff were professional and friendly. It was a great traveling experience overall. Thank you! We were “bumped” from our rebooked flight after having a boarding pass and seat assigned. No explanation except that the Air Canada Service rep said that they “f’d up”. This is after a previous 5 hour delay in Amsterdam. Pros: "Nothing good to say for this flights overall." Cons: "Spent over two hours on the plane/tarmac waiting for take off. Air Canada sucks." Pros: "Consistent experience that gets you from A to B while providing nice perks (free stame-day standby on the old Rapidair routes)." Pros: "I sat in a seat that wasn’t my assigned seat, and no one said anything. It was awesome!" Cons: "The flight was fine, but the aircraft arrived 3 hours late. That’s a long wait." Pros: "Service counter staff was helpful to confirm seating although I did not like being put on standby. This happens too often with Air Canada." Cons: "Stop the overbooking!!!!!" Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "I didn’t like anything about this flight, except that we arrived safely. I had the last seat, next to the toilet, and that container or whatever it is, was dirty. Every time someone flushed, I was bathed in the smell of urine. It was raining in Toronto; consequently, my checked bag was wet through. I’m glad I was coming home rather than arriving at a vacation destination, where all my stuff would’ve been wet. I’d like to see some effort put into keeping my bag dry. Also, the passengers had to slog through the rain to get on the plane!" Cons: "Late. Wifi on the aircraft but didn’t work. Inflation GHY service suspended due to reported turbulence." Pros: "The seat beside me was vacant, so I had extra room." Cons: "Flights in the late evening from Toronto to Ottawa always seem to be delayed. We spent a lot of time boarding, and a lot of time de-icing before take off. There would have been plenty of time to serve refreshments during de-icing. But refreshments and dismemberment of ear phones only began once the plane was airborne. There was not enough time to service all the passengers at that point. I'm not sure why Air Canada cannot at least give you ear phones when boarding. And why cannot refreshments be served during de-icing?" Can't be happy with a 5 hour delay. Only given $10 voucher for food and still EVERYTHING was an upcharge during the flight. TThe first time I have ever flown with flare and both ways sucked There was no entertainment There was no food or beverage service , not even a glass of water The plane door could not be opened upon arrival I try to buy water the cabin crews told me I had to wait for them to come around with the trolley I waited over 2 hours !!!!! Literally 2 hours I was so thirsty . Lots of leg room in the front rows. Wish water was free. I don't like anything. The crew was so bad. Misbehaved badly. The worst flight. Long wait for baggage check in with only one on site attendant. The worst airlines I have seen in my life they don’t respect anyone they don’t care about anyone they lost our luggage and no one is responding. We waited for five hours to get our luggage back.🤬🤬🤬👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 Great staff. Cramped seating for someone 5 feet, 2 inches and average weight. So if you're tall or heavy -- good luck. Even if you wait until the 24 hour checkin time, you still charge for seating. Really? So either it is a less-than-pleasant experience or pay the price of a "big name" airline. And if I'm going to pay their prices, why would I fly in your cramped seat? So, in the end, you want to give less comfort for the same prices as Air Canada. Go figure.
