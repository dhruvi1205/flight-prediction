Cons: "I had significant delays on both the flight to Logan & the flight back to Charlotte." Cons: "The headphone jack.was worn out, so the audio was sporadic." Pros: "Crew was nice and accommodating. Plenty of leg room in regular cabin. Good entertainment options.?" Pros: "so easy. thank you for having Starbucks in the DCA and BOS terminals. got text msgs about delays and all smooth!" Pros: "This older airplane has lots of room. And has free TV and movies on domestic flights on all seats." Cons: "However an older plane does not have touch screens and movie choice is limited." Pros: "Boarding was great and on-time. Flight took a bit longer due to the weather." Cons: "Couldn't understand any of the in-flight announcements. My in-flight entertainment didn't work right." Pros: "I've been flying budget airlines for so long that I was almost shocked to fly an airline that actually cares about its passengers! I kid you not, when they offered coffee to all passengers, I was so sure they would charge us I turned it down. Then, I noticed no one else was paying for it. The next time free snacks and drinks came around, I made sure to grab some! I also appreciated the few extra inches of leg room in every row. Being 6'3", not many planes are designed with your comfort in mind. I fit fairly comfortably in a non-emergency row seat. Last time I flew to Baltimore for work, I had a terrible experience with a different airline. It was $200 less expensive than most airlines, but I ended up paying more in baggage fees and seats. It was only a 1 hour flight and My boss said, "Cheap things usually cost you more, in money, time, and emotion" and nothing has been truer. I always assumed that flights were always unpleasant experiences. Now, I know better." Cons: "The seats, while having more than average leg room, still weren't very comfortable. Not that I'm expecting a luxury experience while flying economy, but I felt as though the headrest was farther back than average. I can usually fall asleep on a plane and wake up without neck pain, but I really struggled to even figure out a relaxing position this time around. I also did not know that JetBlue did not serve meals on cross-country flights. Or, on any flights for that matter. Had I known, I probably would've picked up a breakfast sandwich before boarding." Pros: "There was a weather delay and we were kept informed. Communications from the pilots were able to be understood. Best ever in that regard." Pros: "The crew members were great- really friendly and accommodating." Cons: "Turbulence. But like... nobody can make that stop so basically it was perfect" Cons: "Had to pick up gate-checked bag at carousel. But it arrived quickly." Pros: "Crew are always top notch, free drinks are readily available and entertainment system is great." Cons: "The food portions and quality have definitely declined over the years sadly, as carriers cut costs no doubt." Pros: "The crew was so kind and amazing. They definitely made our flight great!" Cons: "The entertainment wasn’t working for most of the flight. We only got about an hour and a half of entertainment" Pros: "Great crew, good in-flight movies. Good food." Cons: "Wifi connectivity was poor for most of the flight. Plane was very hot it was difficult to sleep." Pros: "Amazing crew, excellent drinks and decent food. Very comfortable seat" Cons: "Everything was great" Pros: "Crew was great !!!" Cons: "Seating in upper class is uncomfortable and bedding is not fresh." Pros: "Crew was great. Flight was on time and crew helped the boarding process go smoothly. It was nice to get a beer or wine at no additional cost." Cons: "Seat was shockingly small, even for economy class. TV was poor quality." Pros: "The flight itself was good! The one from London to Delhi was better than from JFK to London" Cons: "I wasn’t told about my baggage were being delivered through different airlines the other day!" Pros: "Food was delicious, consistent timely service and excellent entertainment options onboard. The flight was an hour early!" Pros: "The flight felt so short, service was amazing, food was good. Great overall experience." Pros: "Great, friendly, professional crew, clean comfortable plane. Loved that full dinner and baggage and wine was included in an economy class overnight from DC to London as well as breakfast. Best flight in a long time, will definitely fly again." Cons: "the tv screen's touch screen capabilities could use an upgrade, it was a hassle to navigate, not very sensitive to touch." Flight was cancelled after 3 1/2 hours. Support for rebooking was overwhelmed. Lost first class tickets and to fly economy. Pros: "The crew was great. The pilots too." Cons: "The audio and video at my seat did not work correctly." Cons: "Nothing, really. Airlines unfortunately can’t make people patient or polite, & I can’t afford a private jet, so I’ll have to settle for an eye roll or twelve." Cons: "Plane was late taking off. Crew did not provide water when requested. They were busy with beverages that they could sell at a cost." Pros: "The only thing I liked about the experience and flight was the Delta Sky Club" Cons: "Everything" Pros: "Seat was hard, not much foot space" Cons: "My wife and Iasked for a snack, it was never delivered" Pros: "Crew was friendly" Cons: "An hour and a half late, terrible communication about scheduling" Pros: "nice crew" Cons: "terrible seat comfort, late departure due to airline’s booking problems" Pros: "Lisa @ the Boston Delta check-in counter is AMAZING! She's super helpful and essentially saved our vacation! Her coworkers say she's the best and I couldn't agree more! Delta is very lucky to have someone like Lisa on their team!" Cons: "Nothing to complain about! If I really head to be picky maybe the in-flight meals were smaller than I expected. But again, nothing that bothered me" Pros: "Great service. Smooth flight. Funny flight attendants. No issues boarding or deplaning." Cons: "Food wasn’t great. What’s new?" Pros: "Check in was very smooth. Flight crew was very attentive" Cons: "Presentation of food was not great." Pros: "Flight delayed due to tech issue but they still boarded us and held on plane no water no bathroom no cell phone signal for 5 hours" Cons: "The accommodation of passengers in the event of a flight cancellation" Cons: "Avianca flight from Bogota to Guayaquil was l4 hours ate in arriving and connecting fight from Guayaquil to San Cristobal, already over an hour late in leaving Guayaquil would not Waite an extra 20 minutes for us. Only 1 flight a day from Guayaquil to San Cristobal so we are faced with a an overnigh" Pros: "Enjoy the direct flight. Entertainment options are great. Crew is courteous and helpful." Cons: "Seat is not comfortable at all, especially for short stature like me. Tough for a six hour, overnight flight." Pros: "Flight conexión departed on time" Cons: "Did not have any help for conecting flight despite late departure from Lima" Pros: "What I like most was the young man that checked in my suit cases. He was beyond amazing: personable, professional, understanding, and overall amazing!" Cons: "The plane from Boston to Bogota was a bit late, but not by much." Pros: "Good entertainment and food." Cons: "The flight was quite delayed, and also had to wait a while once landed. Not much leg space." Cons: "Entertainment only in Spanish is very poor for a long haul flight, as there were many English on board to Heathrow. When questioning this we were simply told it was technical, nothing could be done." Cons: "I was told hours before my flight that my flight was delayed due to weather in the NYC area and that the new flight time was two hours later. There were no weather issues at this time. This delay made me miss my connection and the only option was for me to have a 24 hour layover in Bogota, Colombia. As a woman traveling alone this was not acceptable to me but I had no other choice. I got a hotel room for the evening and tried to make the best of it. I was not offered any compensation for this inconvenience, nothing, not even an offer to pay for my hotel room. Similar things happened to three other people in my group that I was meeting in Peru all traveling from different locations. I lost an entire day in Peru because of this. On my return flight Avianca changed the times as well and I was forced to take an earlier fight home the day before I was scheduled to leave. I therefore lost a total of two days of my vacation because of Avianca and they did NOTHING to compensate me for it. STAY AWAY FROM THIS AIRLINE!!!" Pros: "I arrived to my destination safely." Cons: "Sound didn’t work for the sreen in headrests on my whole row. Asked if they could reset, kept being told they would, but never did. Seats are extremely uncomfortable. Butt and back hurt. No good air circulation, especially if you sit by the window. The middle seat feels it more. Lack of caring from crew unless you spoke Spanish." Cons: "No internet available (2020). For the my previous flight, a month ago, was the same problem." Pros: "Crew is excellent, polite and personal!" Cons: "Plane is super old and outdated. Comfort seat is not, comfortable, very tight. TV screen is not good quality, with the old controls on a handset. No touch, no 1/8 inch audio jack (it has the old 3 holes one). Wifi for streaming freezes every other second. Just make a face lift to the plane, everything else is good." Pros: "Decent price for economy comfort seat, 4A." Cons: "The flight was delayed about 80 minutes and they did not informed until when I got to the Airport. I could have stayed more at home instead of the terminal. They have also changed the boarding gate.." Pros: "Great atmosphere, crew was excellent!" Cons: "I’m 6’5”, so legroom can always be a complaint, but this wasn’t too bad. The plane appeared to be fairly old and didn’t have WiFi. Entertainment also was on an older screen which was navigated by using an old in-seat phone." Cons: "Half the screens were not working - crew were made aware but nothing was done. Vegetarian choices were poor to non-existent ; I witnessed crew insist to a passenger that there were no vegetarian options! They finally cobbled something together for him but not a pleasant experience" Pros: "Seats super comfy. Ended up with 3 seats to myself that formed a bed for the lap Uk to NZ. Very nice!" Pros: "Seat was good" Cons: "Depart on time (1 hour late), hostess put a laptop in the overhead, which fell out and hit me when the bin was opened" Pros: "Crew was fantastic, seats and entertainment was great. Very good food choices." Cons: "Everything was very good." Cons: "Flight on time would have been good when you have a late evening arrival. Long wait for luggage at Birmingham airport."
