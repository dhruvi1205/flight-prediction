It stayed humid the whole time A 6.0 Okay Anonymous, Aug. 2022 Humidity smell in the room and constant weed smell on the hallway A 6.5 Okay Anonymous, Jun. 2019 Pros:Pool and hot tub areas were nice. Convenience store open until midnight. Cons:Upon getting in we were immediately accosted by time share resort salespeople who were very aggressive and wanted us to pay a down payment to listen to their spiel. The shuttle (not affiliated with the hotel) to universal studios is only by advance booking and the booking person wasn't available in the afternoon, so you have to wake up early to hope you can reserve seats. It also takes an hour, so the alternative is an Uber or cab for about $10 twice a day - the hotel is really not within walking distance of the park. The rooms were fine but smelled a bit like old smoke and mildew, and they somehow ran out of towels for us and never brought them up. One night, our entire floor reeked of pot smoke (great for a hotel full of small kids) and the desk staff said they couldn't do anything because we didn't know where it was coming from. Overall decent for the price but not a luxury stay by any means. A 6.2 Okay Anonymous, May 2018 Pros:Facilities and location. Cons:Door lock was broken, to enter room had to turn knob up and not down like a normal room. The room had a smell not sure the reason but it was not welcoming. Thanks C 10.0 Wonderful C, Feb. 2018 Pros:Room was huge. We had a suite. Pool, hot tub area fantastic. Nice bar, restaurant. Staff was unreal. Cannot say enough from the front desk on arrival to the cleaning and maintenance staff everybody was super friendly, helpful and always acknowledged us. Cons:Room was a little dated but we were only really in it to sleep. Rest of hotel was very updated looking. Would not keep me from coming back. I would stay again in a heartbeat. A 4.0 Mediocre Anonymous, Apr. 2017 Pros:Location is good, female reception staff are friendly and has a smile. Cons:Shower was that slow, it felt like it was a watering can that was blocked. Reported this but nothing can of it. Male reception staff are unfriendly and face that looked like it was slapped with a wet fish. No pillow just cushions for sleeping on, what's this all about: A 5.1 Fair Anonymous, Apr. 2017 Pros:Location is good as it is near Prime 1 oulets, restaurants like IHOP, KFC, Subway are also close by. The female reception staff are frienly and build a rapport with you, Parking is free and plenty of spaces. Laundry is a bonus Cons:Were do I start, the male reception staff are cold unfriendly and do not smile. The decor is out dated in the corridors and the room, feels like they brought in six million somkers and let them somke away, not good. The pillows are not pillows in the room they are cushions why!! The AC unit is to load, barely get through the night with the noise. The biggest issue we had was the shower, it felt like you may as well go outside and wait for rain to wash the shower gel/soap away. Reported this to reception, who said they will get it looked at, and nothing changed, make sure you add an extra 15-30 minutes to make sure you feel clean from soap. BW - you need to get this sorted, and fix the water pressure. A 7.4 Good Anonymous, Feb. 2017 Pros:Room had a fridge n microwave which are always appreciated. Nice pool n nice staff. Cons:The place had a off odor. Not terrible but not good. I bought some febreeze n nuked the room n hallway a couple times while there. A 2.0 Poor Anonymous, Jan. 2017 Pros:The toilet broke 3 times. Shouldn't have to worry about that when you pay almost $200 to stay there. Just wanted to relax.
