Cons: "Boarding process was slow and chaotic" Pros: "The check-in process was very easy and friendly. The flight attendants seemed nicer than other airlines." Cons: "From Vancouver to Los Angeles no screen seats no Entertainment" Pros: "I liked the complementary beverages and snacks." Cons: "It would have been nice to be able to access entertainment withou t having to download an app and having a cell phone." Cons: "We didnt have enough time to make the connection between the fly . We ran for all aeropuert and almost loss the fly to Lax" Pros: "Smooth flight, staff are all friendly! Overall a great trip!" Cons: "Food and entertainment require extra charge, although I understand that it is standard for short trips and smaller planes." Pros: "on Time, smooth fight, great staff" Cons: "no more TV in the seats. Not everyone fly's with electronic devices" Pros: "Crew did a good job, even with the long delays." Cons: "Plane was almost 2 hours late getting to LA. Started with the crew needing to clear customs in Vancouver. Delayed by 30 minutes....then the crew preboarded a sick lady and her travel companion. At some point crew decided she should not fly to LA, but the ladies wouldn’t get off plane! 45 minutes later and 4 RCMP show up to escort them off plane. Then we didn’t have any ground crew to get us off loading ramp. Finally got away 90 minutes or more after scheduled departure. Circled LA a few times before getting to land.... long flight with long delays!" Pros: "Uncomfortable, babies crying. Flight attendants disappeared after first drinks. No offers of head phones, snacks etc Delta Flight from Tampa to Minneapolis was excellent" Cons: "Mentioned above" Pros: "Friendly crew." Cons: "The flight was delayed three hours, including having to de-plane and board a new plane, due to a backup generator lying engine issue. Totally unacceptable." Can't be happy with a 5 hour delay. Only given $10 voucher for food and still EVERYTHING was an upcharge during the flight. TThe first time I have ever flown with flare and both ways sucked There was no entertainment There was no food or beverage service , not even a glass of water The plane door could not be opened upon arrival I try to buy water the cabin crews told me I had to wait for them to come around with the trolley I waited over 2 hours !!!!! Literally 2 hours I was so thirsty . Lots of leg room in the front rows. Wish water was free. I don't like anything. The crew was so bad. Misbehaved badly. The worst flight. Long wait for baggage check in with only one on site attendant. The worst airlines I have seen in my life they don’t respect anyone they don’t care about anyone they lost our luggage and no one is responding. We waited for five hours to get our luggage back.🤬🤬🤬👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 Great staff. Cramped seating for someone 5 feet, 2 inches and average weight. So if you're tall or heavy -- good luck. Even if you wait until the 24 hour checkin time, you still charge for seating. Really? So either it is a less-than-pleasant experience or pay the price of a "big name" airline. And if I'm going to pay their prices, why would I fly in your cramped seat? So, in the end, you want to give less comfort for the same prices as Air Canada. Go figure. The airplane smokes and they think it's normal.... this is sign of deterioration WestJet7.7 Flair Airlines6.4 Book cheap flights from Toronto to Los Angeles Recent one-way flight deals Only flying one-way?
