We booked our tickets in August of 2017, Turkish Airlines could've told us this. During booking, they ask for passport expiry date, what's the point if you're not going to tell us in advance and wait till our travel date to tell us this information. We couldn't travel on our vacation as planned and we were charged an additional $3,000 to change our tickets." Pros: "The ground and flight crews were outstanding. Boarding was easy in Houston. I got to see the flight crew handle a medical emergency and saw that they were well prepared, efficient, and concerned. The food and entertainment were fine. I felt like the seat space was better than on British which I often use. I had an empty seat next to me however. I was impressed that the flight crew moved a taller gentleman to a premium (exit) seat to accommodate his extra tall stature. He didn't ask, but they wanted him to be comfortable." Cons: "The airport in Istanbul is pretty manageable. They changed the gate on us twice for the connection, which meant a bit of walking. But the crowd was pretty manageable compared to LHR."
