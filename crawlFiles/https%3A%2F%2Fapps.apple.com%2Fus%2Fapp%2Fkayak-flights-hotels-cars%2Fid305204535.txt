Ratings and Reviews 4.8 out of 5 379.7K Ratings 379.7K Ratings RedXIII_ , 06/15/2018 A joy to use Kayak has been a fantastic company to use for anything travel! & has continued to impress me with their fun and very easy to use features. Airline companies often set standard pricing for their flights and the caveat that the normal person is looking for it matching all these flights with their specific needs i.e. layover timeline, # of bags, airline make/model, & flight times. A ‚ÄòGood Deal‚Äô is a very generalized term and many other apps use that as their main means of persuasion when in fact it‚Äôs clear that sites like Kayak are so good at categorizing exactly what meets your needs and alining airliners to your schedule, like advertised they have a multitude of tools like bag number and layover timeline settings with a accurate representation of what the cost will be regardless if it is two separate companies. If you choose a flight selection that has a 2 hour layover for one airliner and you select ‚Äòbook‚Äô the airliners website which it directs you to within the app has that selection already selected. I could go on and on about how easy and secure this app is to use so please give it a try. BEWARE: WARNING , 02/09/2022 Use hopper instead I‚Äôve used hopper forever as I travel monthly. A friend recommended kayak and I have booked 2 trips with it. The first it rerouted my and added another stop without letting me know on a round trip. The second, which inspired this review was a multi city trip. It messed up my reservation and I spent an hour at the help desi fixing it during check in for the first flight. After this story, it rerouted us for our next stop to have a layover in city in the opposite direction without sharing this information to or giving an indication as to what happened to our initial booking. I then went in to move a flight time after already paying for the insurance, I looked up how to do this on their app and when I hit ‚Äúchange‚Äù to see other options it simply DELETED our flight reservation with no notification or prompt warning us. We were not given a refund or other alternatives to switch back in or change flights. If you were wondering they do not have customer service as they say you need to contact the airline for assistance as they are only a third party site. For our flight home it has moved our reservation to the following day when I work and with another timely layover. I genuinely never write reviews but I hope this saves someone the trouble üòä Developer Response , Hi there, Feel free to share screenshots or more information about your booking experience with the provider of your reservation via www.kayak.com/support. We'll gladly take a closer look. H3110 101 , 03/05/2019 I love this app I got this app for one plane flight, simple as that. I was planning on deleting it right after because I thought I had no use for it. But then I started to realize that any trips I was planning on taking would show up on this app and would be organized by time and date (because I connected my email). I‚Äôm planning on taking an Amtrak to the airport and then back again & accidentally chose the wrong date for the train back, and because Kayak organizes the trips so well, I was able to catch that but if not for this app, that would have been $20 down the bin & a missed class. I honestly love this app because there are no annoying adds that pop up when I‚Äôm trying to figure my plans out & it helps me organize everything so well. It also works offline when I‚Äôm looking at my already planned trips which will help out a lot when I‚Äôm abroad. I don‚Äôt use the search tool within the app for hotels cars or flights, but they have that option as well.
