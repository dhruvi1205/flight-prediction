KAYAK’s top tips for renting a car in London Surrey Hills is ideal for short drives if you want access to the most scenic places in England and still be close to the city center. If you don't mind heading out of town, you can pick up a pre-planned route and then drive cheap car rentals in London about 77 miles to the Cotswold, Sevenoaks, or Epping Forest area that boasts over 100 lakes and ponds, making it a great spot for couples, families and pet enthusiasts. You will have an incident-free trip provided you ensure toddlers are secured in age-appropriate booster seats, and all your passengers wear seat belts at all times. London is a tough city to operate a vehicle, especially at peak times. If you're going to do a lot of driving around central London from Monday to Friday, between 7 am and 6 pm, including 12 pm to 6 pm on weekends and bank holidays, you may incur a Congestion Charge. It will cost you approximately £15 ($18) if you pay the fee in advance or on the same day via Auto Pay, online, or by telephone. If you make payment up to 3 days after traveling, a rate of £17.50 ($22) applies and up to £150 ($184) in fines if you default on payments. The Congestion Zone is labeled with the letter "C" in a red circle on signs and painted on the road. Depending on the time of year you visit the U.K, for example, between January and March, when temperatures fall below seven degrees, it's advisable to book London car rentals fitted with winter tires. Snow wheels with more than 2mm of tread are essential for safe driving in wintertime. If it's going to be your first time operating cheap car rentals in London during harsh conditions, confirm when booking your vehicle through KAYAK that car rental companies in the U.K provide them. The English capital is an extremely busy city, which means driving around central London can be incredibly stressful. But, while public transportation is the best option when discovering the city center, a rental car is the perfect option for those looking to leave London and explore the English countryside or coastal towns such as Brighton. London has five airports: London City (LCY), London Stansted (STN), London Heathrow (LHR), London Luton (LTN), and London Gatwick (LGW). At City Airport, car rental counters are located next to the main terminal building. At Heathrow Airport, car rental companies have desks in all the arrivals terminals. At Gatwick, you'll find car rental desks in both the North and South terminal. Stansted Airport's car rental companies operate from the Airport Car Rental Village, which is outside the terminal building (free shuttle buses that will drop you off there depart from the terminal forecourt every 10 minutes). The Car Hire Center at Luton Airport is accessed via the free APCOA shuttle bus, which you can catch at Bay 1A. The main thing you have to know about driving in the United Kingdom is that traffic runs on the left-hand side of the road. If you're brave enough to drive around the city center, beware that the streets are constantly bustling with tourists. Take into consideration that certain areas in the city are subject to the Congestion Charge, which means you must pay £11.50 (approximately $14.70) per day if you drive in said zones between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m., which is applicable Monday to Friday. Driving during London's rush hour can easily add 40 minutes to an hour to your travel time, so avoid going into and out of central London between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m., and again in the evening, between 4 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. Roads leading to the city's many airports are often busy during these times as well, so take that into consideration if you're driving back to the airport. 25% of our users found rental cars in London for C$ 32 or less Book your rental car in London at least 1 day before your trip in order to get a below-average price Off-airport rental car locations in London are around 188% more expensive than airport locations on average Economy rental cars in London are around 69% cheaper than other car types, on average London car rental experiences: the best tips from KAYAK users Insights shared by verified travelers who rented a car in London Learn how KAYAK collects reviews and tips from users.

We also had to buy insurance, as we could not show proof that our credit card covered excess insurance laibility. Shuttle buses run every 45 minutes, so there is a long wait 2.0 Poor Nov. 2019 Pros:Nothing! Stay away and help put disreputable businesses out of business! Cons:Bait and switch. Got a price that looked great, but when I got there not only did they have an inferior car to the one I booked, that they tried to pass off, but the price they charged was over 40% higher than when I booked online. (Looking at the other reviews, I'm not the only one in this position) I walked out after confirming that they wouldn't charge me anything, and they charged me over 90 dollars (in dispute with credit card). I then went to a big name brand like I should have in the first place. 4.0 Mediocre Sep. 2019 Pros:The Pickup was the worst pickup scenario I've ever seen. There's a kiosk to 'skip the line' that you can use, but you need to get in the line after anyway. We had to deposit about $1200. The pickup process took about 2 hours. The car we received wasn't the class we requested, nor clean. Cons:Clearer indication of where to go when arriving. More staff. Working Kiosks. A real waiting area. Quicker service. Most importantly advance information on required deposits (I would never have rented from here had I known it was a $1200 USD deposit required). 2.0 Poor Aug. 2019 Pros:The young teenager working there was probably the only person that was courteous and understanding there. Cons:Booked car for 11am. Didn't get car until 1:45pm. Car was wall banged up and cut on tire. They said it's all good. Protested to get another car as I didn't feel safe. Returned car at 11:45amnext day to be scold by clerk who said needed to be returned by 11 and others waited for 3h for it. Scammers! 2.4 Poor Aug. 2019 Pros:I can't think of anything. Cons:A clean car, not waiting for an hour to, a car that had been serviced and didn't breakdown on the M4, better customer service, clearer information on using a travel credit card for accident coverage. 3.6 Poor Jul. 2019 Cons:This was the nightmare experience I have heard about but always thought was exaggerated. On the third day of our rental, the clutch went out on our car. They charged me $3000 and left me on the side of the road for 5 hours. No replacement rental.

Upgrade to GPS was good. 10.0 Wonderful Sep. 2022It was impossible to phone these people on Saturday morning. I returned the car one day early. It was unclear where to drop the car, but I figured it out, and then got stuck in the parking garage. I had to squeak out when a car left. I found the budget website unhelpful and also the customer support number. But overall I was delighted and the car was great. It was somewhat disconcerting that they didn’t inspect the car when I brought it in and they said I would be billed at a later time. They required rather large deposit upfront. So I had to trust them on that 2.0 Poor Aug. 2022- We were told that we if had to return the car early we won't be charged anything on top of what we have paid, even if out rental agreement had a minimum period - We were not told about the city supplement fee at pick-up nor drop-off - We were charged a damage fee for a damage that was there at time of pick-up without being sent an invoice or anything like that, money just disappeared from my account - I had to wait a total of 95 minutes on hold for someone to respond to our concerns 9.2 Wonderful Jan. 2020 Pros:The staff were great, the car was great. Cons:We arrived in terminal 2 and there are only shuttles from terminal 3. With a toddler and all the bags and car seats that entails it was a long walk . 6.4 Okay Oct. 2019 Pros:Location was good for pickup and dropoff Cons:The car had built in GPS with touch screen but the budget car rental rep gladly sold me GPS charging for it. They gave me a toddler seat for my 9 month baby and had nothing else. 9.6 Wonderful Oct. 2019 Pros:It was easy to get to and deliver the car on return Cons:I have no response about getting my deposit back and, the fare that I received did not include any insurance so it was more expensive that I expected Back 1 out of 21 Next Sixt 7.5 Good83 reviews Cleanliness 8.2 Comfort 8.1 Pick-up/Drop-off 7.3 Value for money 6.9 17 locations in LondonShow locations from C$ 58/day View deals Sixt reviewsCar rental locations Locations in London 144-146 Hammersmith Road +44 20 7018 8246 Monday 08:00 - 18:00 Tuesday 08:00 - 18:00 Wednesday 08:00 - 18:00 Thursday 08:00 - 18:00 Friday 08:00 - 18:00 Saturday 08:00 - 18:00 Sunday 08:00 - 18:00 View deals 146-158 Kensington High Street +44 207 018 8246 Monday 07:30 - 19:00 Tuesday 08:00 - 18:00 Wednesday 08:00 - 18:00 Thursday 08:00 - 18:00 Friday 08:00 - 18:00 Saturday 08:00 - 18:00 Sunday 09:00 - 13:00 View deals 152-154 Blackhorse Road +44 20 7018 8246 Monday 08:00 - 18:00 Tuesday 08:00 - 18:00 Wednesday 08:00 - 18:00 Thursday 08:00 - 18:00 Friday 08:00 - 18:00 Saturday 08:00 - 18:00 Sunday 08:00 - 18:00 View deals 16 Shepherds Bush Green +44 20 7018 8246 Monday 08:00 - 18:00 Tuesday 08:00 - 18:00 Wednesday 08:00 - 18:00 Thursday 08:00 - 18:00 Friday 08:00 - 18:00 Saturday 08:00 - 18:00 Sunday 08:00 - 18:00 View deals 16-19 Canada Square +44 20 7018 8246 Monday 08:00 - 18:00 Tuesday 08:00 - 18:00 Wednesday 08:00 - 18:00 Thursday 08:00 - 18:00 Friday 08:00 - 18:00 Saturday 08:00 - 18:00 View deals 179-199 Holland Park Avenue +44 20 7018 8246 Monday 08:00 - 18:00 Tuesday 08:00 - 18:00 Wednesday 08:00 - 18:00 Thursday 08:00 - 18:00 Friday 08:00 - 18:00 Saturday 08:00 - 18:00 Sunday 08:00 - 18:00 View deals 22 Park Lane +44 20 7018 8246 Monday 08:00 - 18:00 Tuesday 08:00 - 18:00 Wednesday 08:00 - 18:00 Thursday 08:00 - 18:00 Friday 08:00 - 18:00 Saturday 08:00 - 18:00 View deals 275 Queenstown Road +44 20 7018 8246 Monday 08:00 - 18:00 Tuesday 08:00 - 18:00 Wednesday 08:00 - 18:00 Thursday 08:00 - 18:00 Friday 08:00 - 18:00 Saturday 08:00 - 18:00 Sunday 08:00 - 18:00 View deals 457-463 Caledonian Road +44 20 7018 8246 Monday 08:00 - 18:00 Tuesday 08:00 - 18:00 Wednesday 08:00 - 18:00 Thursday 08:00 - 18:00 Friday 08:00 - 18:00 Saturday 07:00 - 19:00 Sunday 07:00 - 19:00 View deals 54 Buckingham Gate +44 20 7018 8246 Monday 09:00 - 13:00 Tuesday 09:00 - 13:00 Wednesday 09:00 - 13:00 Thursday 09:00 - 13:00 Friday 09:00 - 13:00 View deals Chestnut Plaza, Monfichet Rd +44 20 7018 8246 Monday 08:00 - 18:00 Tuesday 08:00 - 18:00 Wednesday 08:00 - 18:00 Thursday 08:00 - 18:00 Friday 08:00 - 18:00 Saturday 08:00 - 18:00 Sunday 08:00 - 18:00 View deals International Way +44 20 7018 8246 Monday 08:00 - 18:00 Tuesday 08:00 - 18:00 Wednesday 08:00 - 18:00 Thursday 08:00 - 18:00 Friday 08:00 - 18:00 Saturday 07:00 - 19:00 Sunday 07:00 - 19:00 View deals London Regatta Centre,Dockside +44-844-4993399 Opening times not available View deals Pancras Rd/Eurostar +44 20 7018 8246 Monday 08:00 - 18:00 Tuesday 08:00 - 18:00 Wednesday 08:00 - 18:00 Thursday 08:00 - 18:00 Friday 08:00 - 18:00 Saturday 08:00 - 18:00 Sunday 08:00 - 18:00 View deals Sofitel London Heathrow T5 +44 20 7018 8246 Monday 07:00 - 19:00 Tuesday 07:00 - 19:00 Wednesday 07:00 - 19:00 Thursday 07:00 - 19:00 Friday 07:00 - 19:00 Saturday 07:00 - 19:00 Sunday 07:00 - 19:00 View deals Terminal 2 Landside Arrivals +44 20 7018 8246 Monday 06:00 - 22:00 Tuesday 06:00 - 22:00 Wednesday 06:00 - 22:00 Thursday 06:00 - 22:00 Friday 06:00 - 22:00 Saturday 06:00 - 22:00 Sunday 06:00 - 22:00 View deals Victoria St +44 20 7018 8246 Monday 08:00 - 18:00 Tuesday 08:00 - 18:00 Wednesday 08:00 - 18:00 Thursday 08:00 - 18:00 Friday 08:00 - 18:00 Saturday 08:00 - 18:00 Sunday 08:00 - 18:00 View deals Filters Wonderful (26) Very good (3) Good (0) Okay (1) Fair (0) Mediocre (4) Poor (9) Reviews 10.0 Wonderful Oct. 2022After sales service also good.

Elevator down to collect the car. Everything together roughly 90 minutes. 10.0 Wonderful Jul. 2022A very nice car, large enough for 5 passengers and 4 cases, good sat navigation.

I did get a refund nice and easily that was convenient. 2.0 Poor Jan. 2020 Cons:They are a corrupt business that rip off customers, just see news articles online (e.g false damage claims, not honoring rates). Because they appear on Kayak they also damage Kayak’s brand too). 2.8 Poor Jan. 2020 Cons:They say free shuttle but you have have to pay for tickets both ways and email them receipt when you get home to get reimbursed( as far as I’m concerned that’s not free). Car exterior was very dirty on pickup and they require you to go out alone and look for additional damage on a dirty car to see if you can find something they missed. Standard legally required insurance was not included in price of car through booking site( or that’s what they said when I got there). Overall it felt like a dirty slimy operation that is designed to rip people off every chance they get. Every body re ting there was angry and seemed to feel the same way. Staff was for most part indifferent to the negativity by the customers and you can tell they just deal with it all day due to the companies for policies. Definitely worth layyng a little extra to go with a sta and brand such as enterprise or Alamo etc.... 6.8 Okay Oct. 2019 Pros:We were surprised at the extra costs at the point of sale from when we did the online booking. The staff were very helpful in giving us options and a better deal though. Cons:They need to advertise the extra costs beyond what is quoted online. There were two other customers just while we were there very angry with the rise in quote. 4.0 Mediocre Sep. 2019 Cons:They were grilling me for a small scratch on the car. Luckily I had a picture showing the scratch existed before I picked the car. Lot of hidden charges almost double the amount. 2.8 Poor May 2019 Pros:I didn’t enjoy my experience with Green motion and will never ever again go with them. In the morning I was refuse the rental because my printed paperless bank statement was without stamp. And when returned later I was told they are closed, but if I pay extra £36 they will give me a car Cons:The staff at the London city airport office are so rude, unprofessional and unpolite.

Ended up paying triple of what I thought I was going to. I would suggest a more reputable brand. Might cost more on paper but not worth the headache of this rental experience. Cons:Shuttle to the car park. Clear terms and conditions. 3.6 Poor Feb. 2020 Cons:The car I requested was not available, the insurance I prepaid I was told was not god enough. I had to pay an extra 350GBP on pick up 6.8 Okay Sep. 2019 Pros:Clean new car. Cons:More information about the true costs incurred with the rental (e.g. insurance, milage). 2.0 Poor Jul. 2019 Pros:Bad customer service Cons:Better communication 2.0 Poor Jul. 2019 Pros:The drop off was fast. Cons:I had a reservation for a car which the sales staff completely ignored to start a new transaction. They proceeded to ignore pricing to push their insurance plan, and basically wouldn't let you leave until you had purchased it. I literally told them what I thought they were doing was a scam.

In Jan 2019 I booked a car for pick up at LHR Dec 16, making the mistake that my flight out of SFO was actually getting into LHR Dec 17. Had I picked up the car Dec 16, I would have been paying $460 for my rental period. With zero flexibility they wanted me to now pay £2000 for the same rental package (1 day less in fact). After a long haul flight with 4 biggish bags - which the Avis shuttle driver gave no help with - I had to go back to T2 and get a car from National for £600. Same size as my original Avis booking, help with baggage into and off of bus and even into my car! Enterprise rocks. Avis sucks big time. 2.0 Poor Sep. 2019 Cons:I made the mistake of not bringing my passport to the rental counter. Although not explicitly stated anywhere in the terms and conditions, a passport for foreign tourists is required to rent a car from Avis Heathrow.

This meant having to get a train with multiple bags which was very challenging for one person. My AMEX credit card was also not accepted (despite having already been used through the broker booking for part payment of the fee) Additionally, I was informed at the counter that I would need to pay extra to be dropped off at the airport on my departure Lastly, the car was dirty and had clearly not been cleaned. The agent offered to clean the car but I was now running late due to the unexpected trip from T4, etc so had to waive this offer Positive: On returning the car a few days later, I provided my poor experience to a gentleman called Sadan, who was handling the car check-in. He was very attentive and extremely customer focused. He apologised for the issues I had encountered and provided a complimentary drop off to the airport. 8.0 Very good Aug. 2023Pick up was outstanding, drop off was a little chaotic however their Manager Sidanne was fantastic 2.0 Poor Apr. 2023There was NOTHING that we liked about this experience. We will NEVER use them or recommend them again. Upon arrival, it took over an hour to find them for transportation to their facility. We had our booking at 9:00 am, at 11:00 am, we were still waiting for someone to talk to us. There were customers waiting who had their bookings at 7:30, and they hadn't been served yet. As we had time sensitive tickets for entry to Stonehenge, we ended up calling a taxi company to pick us up to drive us. The car rental company was supposed to reimburse us, they still have not credited us with our pre-paid rate. This was a HORRIBLE experience, we do NOT recommend them to anyone. For context, we have travelled extensively around the world and have rented cars everywhere we have travelled, this was by far the WORST EXPERIENCE we have ever encountered. 10.0 Wonderful Sep. 2022All great.

I have been renting cars for 40 years, and never before have I been sold a car without any insurance. In the past there has always been insurance with a modest excess (eg GBP 1,500) which the client is invited to reduce by making an additional payment. I will be careful never to book through you again. 2.0 Poor Jul. 2023It was dodgy, non professional, outright scary and we opted to go with another company 2.0 Poor Jul. 2023My flight arrived at terminal 4, when I called the car rental team I was informed that they didn't pick up from terminal 4 and I would have to make my own way to terminal 2 or 3. Once at terminal 2 or 3 I would need to call them again. When I arrived at terminal 3 I called them and was told someone would pick me up in 10-15 minutes. After 30 minutes I called again and was told that someone would set off now to pick me up, so they hadn't even left their business to pick me up, if I hadn't called again how long would I have been waiting for? Upon arrival to the car rental place, I was informed that I had selected the cheapest option which didn't come with insurance which I needed. They gave me three price options, all which resulted in at least double the price of my original booking. At the time of booking I was not given the option of purchasing insurance, so a very deceitful way of hiding those additional fees making the renter think they have got a good deal. The fuel tank was only half full, resulting in me having to fill up before heading on my 5 1/2 hour drive, where the half tank wouldn't have gotten me to my destination. The gas station was only at the end of their road. Upon returning the car, I once again had to make my own way to the airport - terminal 4. They didn't even offer to take me to terminal 2 or 3. I will not use their service again, nor will I book a car through Kayak again. 2.0 Poor May 2023I got dropped off at terminal on departure. DO NOT USE PAY EXTRA AND USE A MAINSTREAM RENTAL COMPANY. THE PRICE IS MISLEADING THEY CHARGE YOU FOR INSURANCE WHEB COLLECTING THE CAR RATHER THAN TELLING YOU ABOUT THIS BEFORE YOU MAKE THE BOOKING. RUDE AND UMPROFESSIONAL STAFF. CAR SMELT IF SMOKE, WAS UNLEAN AND WING MIRROR WAS TAPED ON DO NOT USE. 8.0 Very good May 2023The guys at the office were very polite and helpful. The one downside is that it took forever to get the car as well as drop it off. It is not a standard rental car counter so be ready for that. 2.0 Poor Nov. 2022Hidden fees of over £145 on a £40 car rental (350%)!! The car was not cleaned, with multiple stains inside the vehicle, and even had chocolate smeared all over the passenger seat.

Luke Abrahams 15 June 2023 London can be quite the odyssey when it comes to navigating its roads. Driving here can be a challenge - especially if you are unfamiliar with the area - which is why most prefer to utilize its famously efficient public transit system, and its king, the Tube. When it comes to leaving the capital in search of greener pastures, renting a car is hands down your best option.

Anyone who rents a car within the United Kingdom will need a valid driving license, as well as a form of ID such as a passport. Visitors must also provide proof of return travel to their country of origin, as well as details of their accommodation. In addition, a checking or credit account is required to cover the security deposit and pay for the car rental itself. What cars are available to rent in London? The smaller the car, the better. Why? A smaller car will help you park in tight spaces, navigate the narrow - and often busy - streets of London, and adjust to being on the opposite side of the road you are used to driving. London is quite literally a melting pot for designer cars, from homegrown greats, from Bentley to Rolls Royce and European imports that range from Ferraris to snug Renaults. If it’s your first time here, the smaller the better as the narrow roads of London can be quite a challenge to navigate when they get busy. In order to fit in (literally), Minis are a great option, as are compact options like a Fiat 500. Where do I rent a car at the airport? All of London’s major airports – Heathrow, Gatwick, Stanstead, and Luton – have car hire companies onsite. Popular choices include Sixt, Hertz, Europcar, Budget, Avis, and Virtuo, among many others. All offer car pick-up and shuttle services at your leisure, and depending on the time or rental, incur an additional collection fee. Can I hire a car outside of the airport? Yes. There are several places to rent a car in London within the city and in local boroughs. Check our handy tool to find the closest car rental service to your hotel. Everything you need to know about car insurance in London Anyone thinking of renting a car in London must get insurance. The city is known for its busy roads and fast-paced lifestyle. Most, if not all car hire companies require drivers to take out insurance but check the fine print as the level of protection differs from company to company. What you should know about driving in London Despite government efforts to reduce congestion on London’s roads, driving remains a popular way of getting around the city. As a result, the roads are often very busy, especially around the morning (6 am to 9 am and evening rush hours 4 pm to 7 pm). If you’re driving into central London, the daily congestion charge fee must be paid before you head in. This covers everything within the ring road from Marylebone across to Shoreditch and down to Victoria and more. Fully electric vehicles and select energy-efficient hybrids are exempt from all low-emission zone charges, so you might be able to save some money in the long run if you choose to rent an electric vehicle. The rules of the road differ depending on what part of the city your car finds itself in, so it’s well worth planning your route before you set off to avoid any unwanted charges. Why? London councils have the power to enforce all sorts of common offenses, such as no left, right, or U-turns, with traffic cameras. It’s also worth noting that you drive on the left in the UK, so take plenty of time to adjust to the new rules of the road. The﻿ dos and don’ts of parking your rental car in London When it comes to finding a spot to park that is relatively close to your destination can be a bit of a challenge. Make sure you have downloaded prior to your London visit, one of these apps to help you find a parking spot: Appy Parking, Parkopedia, RingGo, and JustPark. Apart from finding a good parking spot, there are strict rules about where drivers can leave their vehicles and where they can’t. Markings and signs are good indicators. Apart from Stopping or parking on red routes is prohibited, unless otherwise stated, and any sat nav the car has installed alerts the dos and don’ts along the way. In addition to the red routes, parking on double yellow lines at any time is a big no. Single yellow lines can be parked on at certain times of the day. Parking is allowed on designated dashed white lines, but drivers must follow the rules of the corresponding ‘pay and display signs. Failure to do so will result in you getting a hefty parking ticket. It’s also worth noting that you cannot park on these lines if they are reserved for permit holders. It is also illegal to park on the pavement in London, and in some London boroughs like Islington or Westminster, those driving diesel vehicles will be charged an extra parking surcharge. In addition to road markings, several hotels offer valet car parking spaces, and there are several car parks dotted throughout the city if you choose to leave your vehicle parked for the day. Beware, this can be very costly, though, and sometimes work out even higher than what you paid to rent the car in the first place. Where can I get fuel and how much does it cost in London? Public transit is the cheapest and easiest way to get around London, but you might still need a car rental. Don’t be afraid - even a visitor can fit in like a local if they prepare accordingly. There are plenty of gas stations dotted throughout the city, especially in suburban areas. Shell, BP, and Texaco are some of the big brands to look out for, alongside branded UK supermarkets like Sainsbury’s and Tesco, which generally offer the best prices. The average price of fuel throughout the capital is currently set at £1,47/l (around $1.83) for petrol and £1,66/l (about $2.06) for diesel engines. Those driving an electric car or hybrid vehicle should know that there are multiple charging stations dotted around the capital. EV charging points can be found by searching for one via the Greater London Authority website.
