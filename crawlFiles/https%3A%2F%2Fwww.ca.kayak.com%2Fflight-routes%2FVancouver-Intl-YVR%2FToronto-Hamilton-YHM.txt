I have seen in some other airlines that one is provided with a sticker to place on your seat to show if you can or cannot be woken up" Cons: "The baggage restriction was not good at least one Checking should be allowed" Pros: "I did not make it on the flight as the time was given was 5:35 and the flight left at 4:00." Cons: "I was not given correct information and being a very novice traveller did not check the information." Cons: "From Vancouver to Los Angeles no screen seats no Entertainment" Pros: "Seats had room. Entertainment options were quite good." Cons: "WestJet has lost its Chutzpah. No longer knows it’s identity. Food choices were terrible for a 5.5 hour flight, and the couple of okay choices they were out of very quickly. Crew was friendly enough but no sparkle." Pros: "Smooth trip." Cons: "No one would get a wheelchair to get to cart that was on different floor. Driver didn't volunteer to carry bags to cart." Pros: "Everything about the flight was fine except the delay waiting for the new crew." Cons: "The 90 minute delay taking off. The difficulty getting WestJet Connect entertainment software to work with my laptop. I finally gave up & watched tv on my phone." Pros: "Crew did a good job, even with the long delays." Cons: "Plane was almost 2 hours late getting to LA. Started with the crew needing to clear customs in Vancouver. Delayed by 30 minutes....then the crew preboarded a sick lady and her travel companion. At some point crew decided she should not fly to LA, but the ladies wouldn’t get off plane! 45 minutes later and 4 RCMP show up to escort them off plane. Then we didn’t have any ground crew to get us off loading ramp. Finally got away 90 minutes or more after scheduled departure. Circled LA a few times before getting to land.... long flight with long delays!" Pros: "Had a fantastic experience on my first round trip with WestJet. Very satisfied, would definitely fly them again. I also liked how we were able to clear Customers BEFORE we departed from YVR; made the arrival that much smoother when we landed at SFO" Pros: "Uncomfortable, babies crying. Flight attendants disappeared after first drinks. No offers of head phones, snacks etc Delta Flight from Tampa to Minneapolis was excellent" Cons: "Mentioned above" Flight delayed by 4 hours but no communication. With passengers until after the posted departure time became apparent the flight was not going to board even close to on time. Flight was sent canceled. The absolute most useless staff I have ever witnessed. Utterly careless - literally could not care less. 100% never using this airline again. Poor communication at the check in counter and boarding gates. Other then the screaming baby the flight was fine, nothing special Check in experience was smooth, and the flight attendants were courteous and friendly. Very positive experience overall, thank you all! Flight arrived late but other than that everything else okay Great price for a new plane. Only offered water which we knew.
