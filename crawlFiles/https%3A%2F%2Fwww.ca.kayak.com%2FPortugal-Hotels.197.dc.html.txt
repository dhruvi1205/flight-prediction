Aside from selecting the location, hotels come in star ratings implemented by the National Tourist Board, that range from 1 to 5 stars. While more stars means a more luxurious hotel, the differences between 4 and 5 star hotels aren’t always noticeable. Usually it comes down to a wider range of services, a concierge service, and a 24-hour front office. If you are intending to include some wine tasting in your itinerary, you might like to find yourself a hotel in Porto like Hotel da Bolsa, or in the Douro Valley, such as Refugio d'Anita Douro Valley House. You’ll have access to the famous Port wine either way, but Porto offers a beautiful historic city with baroque churches, while Douro Valley and the north is perfect for nature lovers with its golden hills. To go back in time and experience traditional rural Portuguese life, head to the rolling plains of Alentejo, where you'll find sleepy villages, wild beaches, and regional cuisine. At São Lourenço do Barrocal, you’ll be able to enjoy an organic farm breakfast, with local artisanal bread and other delicacies. If you’re looking for a cheap hotel in Portugal, you should consider visiting during the low season. You'll find cheaper accommodations in Portugal in January and February.
