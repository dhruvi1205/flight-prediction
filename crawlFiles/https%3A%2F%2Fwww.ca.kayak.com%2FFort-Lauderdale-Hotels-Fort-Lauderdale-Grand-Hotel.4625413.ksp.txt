Staff is beyond rude, they don’t say hello or thank you or even say how can I help. The concierge saw me standing there rolled her eyes then wave me to come over, I had to tell her I reservation, then she made the hand gesture as to show ID. I thought she was a mute for second then I see her talk to her co-worker. So, I realize she was just being plan old ignorant at that point. A 2.0 Poor Anonymous, Mar. 2022 Very worn facility with a lot of deferred maintenance. The toilet was missing bolts to prevent it moving around. Advertising photographs are very deceptive. I had chosen this hotel based on staged photography. Not what it appeared. It was noisy with a lot of noncitizens apparently being housed by the government? They appeared to be living there. I was very overpriced I paid for two nights but didn’t sleep there at all. My boss moved me elsewhere. I am requesting a refund D 10.0 Wonderful Demetrius, Oct. 2019 Pros:heated pool was great, walking distance to restaurants. J 2.5 Poor Joshua, Apr. 2019 Pros:Location was okay. Cons:Outlets without covers, lamps that you had to screw in and unscrew lightbulbs to turn off. Tv didn't work. First room's A/C was broken, when I got switched to a different room it was a different type of room and location in the hotel than what I paid for. Staff was rude.
