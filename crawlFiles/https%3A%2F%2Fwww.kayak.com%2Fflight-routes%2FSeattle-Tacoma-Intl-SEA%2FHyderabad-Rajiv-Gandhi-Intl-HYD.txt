Enough, but less than most domestic US flights."Read more about Japan Airlines Pros: "Economy was surprisingly comfortable. Boarding and deplaning were very quick." Cons: "Not a ton of movies to choose from. Enough, but less than most domestic US flights." Pros: "The entertainment system, the leg room, the toilets with complimentary tooth brushes. JAL hit it out of the park." Cons: "Not one thing." Pros: "The cabin crew was excellent -- friendly, always helpful, energetic." Cons: "We requested a seafood special meal. The food quality was satisfactory, but most of the items tasted very bland. The accompanying dishes were unimaginative -- raw vegetables (salad), steamed vegetables, pickled vegetables. One exeption was a smoked salmon bit with capers -- this was the tastiest part among 8 meals over 4 flights." Cons: "The crew members could have been more courteous to clients on the flight by lowering their voices when conversating among themselves." Pros: "The crew always smiles and very accomodating." Cons: "The main course could have been better or improve. I wasn’t satisfied with the taste." Pros: "Soo Much Food! Crew was very polite and helpful." Cons: "They didn’t offer a vegetarian meal option in flight, but there was enough sides that it didn’t really matter." Pros: "On time. Boarding was great. Flight wasn’t full so plenty of room to stretch out." Cons: "No service. No drink, no snack, flight delayed. Missed last bus from airport to station at base where stationed. No happy" Cons: "Food was awful. Huge hassle having to clear immigration pick up bags and check in again in Shanghai." Pros: "Kind people, quality service. Very helpful. On time." Cons: "Had trouble hearing instructions from flight crew since volume of the speakers was low." Pros: "We had to come home 2 weeks early due to the virus, and Singapore airlines were brilliant at changing the flights. Even got upgraded to the extra leg room for free" Cons: "The extra leg room seats were naff, I like getting comfy in a chair and these ones were not. The screen was too far away and the arm rests didn’t move. Also, due to my partner having to swap seats, I was sat on my own next to strangers. They slept the whole way, so the crew never disturbed them meaning I missed out on food and drinks, even when asked" Cons: "The rebalance was worst I've ever encountered I was actually scared I prayed many times 4 yo get home safely I was not impressed with my last flight n also why were We delayed coming from manila we turn back many times n I had only 50 mins to catch my flight to Perth if we had landed wen we should hv I'd hv time to buy some gifts I'm.glad that Philippines airlines will fly direct yo manila from Perth come March n I'll use them from now on as it's a few times in the years gone that things has happened to me I forgave ur airline but now i not need to as hv other airline to fly n my darling come here 3 or 4 times each year but will use Philippines airlines URS sincerely Trevor frahm" Pros: "Crew was super nice and the food was good (for plane food)! Really appreciated that they had snacks and chocolate on hand for hungry passengers throughout the flight. A 17 hour plane ride is never the best, but Singapore Air made it as pleasant as possible. Also, we booked on Kayak and was routed through a third party vendor JustFly, which I was a little worried about - but our booking went off without a hitch." Pros: "crew was pushing , no time in an rush all the time" Cons: "service level" Pros: "Overall, the staff was amazing, so as the food and cleanliness" Cons: "The space between the seats in economic seat" Cons: "The seat covers looked worn and dirty. Needs an upgrade." Pros: "Crew was attentive and made extra effort to meet special requests from passengers." Pros: "Amazing crew and service. My kids were well looked after in business class even though my 2 year old was a little sick. Book the cook meal was excellent and great entertainment options. Seat was enormous!" Cons: "Nothing significant!" Pros: "I didn't like the trip much. After the trip we found out that our body was bitten by fleas. Our body is now full of rashes, every part of my body is so itchy. We was seated in 61A and 61C, seems like in the previous flight a dog was sitting there or some kind of animal that left fleas in the sit." Cons: "Please clean better the seats. This is unacceptable, not a good way to start a trip in Japan. We only hope to get better sitting in our last flight with SQ, from Japan to LA." Pros: "Arrived on time." Cons: "Was a B Grade effort by the crew. They were there to get their pay check & no more....very disappointing." Pros: "Crew was great" Cons: "The seats were pretty stiff compared to the A380 business class seats on my preceding flight." Pros: "Crew and flight comfort were fine until the flight got canceled after sitting on the plane for over an hour" Cons: "Wasn’t happy with the accommodation after the flight cancellation, was told no other flights for 3 days so I ended up paying $250 more to get on a different airline that day to make the wedding I was going for."

Wasn't even able to fold my legs just a bit, was stuck in one position resulting in severe neck pain." Cons: "Emirates charging for duty free merchandise bought in Dubai. It is ridiculous that they add the weight of the duty free merchandise to your carry on luggage and charge at the gate. If I have known that I could have shopped in Dubai duty free. The customer service person was very rude too." Cons: "My entertainment system was not working and the crew wasn’t very helpful about it." Cons: "they have changed how they serve drinks and food. they used to do that separately. now they club it together." Cons: "seats wouldn't recline, they say it is a mechanical, I had to sit uncomfortably for 16 hrs" Pros: "I liked the entertainment and the cabin crew is very welcomjng and nice smaile on their faces." Cons: "The leg room for tall guys isrediculous and if i had to get more leroom even in international flights they r charging. Ive not bren charged in domestic flights till now for leg room. And the food shoydl be changed and please give sime yhing more filling." Pros: "Service was some what better than in the business class." Cons: "I requested special meal when booked my ticket. I was told no vegetarian meal or sea food except for chicken and was given a just a roll and desert. Half an hour later after I finished what was served I was asked if I wanted left over vegitarian dish??????" Qatar screwed up by delaying our onward journey for refueling, which resulted in missing our connecting flight to India. the airport qater staff at Doha, herded us like cattle in a very incohesive and uncoordinated way. We were then given 2 options: either catch our original flight the Next day ( After 24.hrs) or catch 2 flights instead , to goto our destination in India. All this, for paying a premium for Qatar. This flight was packed and undercrewd! Service cart cam by twice on a 14 hour flight Good and comfortable flight Helpful crew Decent food and drinks Very Old flight. I didn’t expect to see this old flight. The entertainment system was very poor for a 15+ hours flight. The staff was amazing and food could is no bad could be better. We encountered a glitch when we tried to board the flight because our boarding passes had been printed by Qatar Airways in Jakarta. Those were not recognized by Alaska’s system also we had to step out of line and have new boarding passes printed. Boarding was delayed by 2 hours since the machine that assigned boarding passes broke down and we were left waiting to drop our luggage Was worse than a low cost carrier. Experience needs to be better for the price paid. Food, entertainment and blankets are minimum requirements for an international flight with a duration of 3+ hrs. None was in this flight and very dirty bathrooms on the top of it. The screen was not clean.It had stains of previous customer .Also the toilets..My daughter got urine infection. Not happy with the cleanliness of aircraft.Also requested multiple time hot beverages but not served at all sighting disturbances. Request on behalf of every passenger please sanitize and clean as we stay for 15 plus hours.. Pros: "Short 4 hour flight, full - not one open seat Yet, the crew was super nice and efficient." Increase the number of available films, including variety. All other aspects were great. Excellent service. departed on time, and arrived ahead of schedule. The whole restrictions around no food/drink is a bit weird even with Covid. Also, no mobiles and iPad use during takeoff and landing is very 2006! Pros: "Thai airways is always good, they are always one of our carriers of choice" Cons: "Not sure why but the crew seemed a little grumpy today. In my experience, this is very unusual for Thai airways staff. Food was nice but not quite up to usual standard." Pros: "We landed safely. Ultimately, that’s all that matters." Cons: "Thai seems to be the only major airline without a transit desk in DPS, so connecting passengers have to waste hours going through immigration and customs, checking in again, then going through security and immigration all over again. Flight was fine except for this waste of 2 hours standing in lines" Cons: "A specially hospitality and food which served in plane was excellent" Pros: "All well arranged. Friendly and helpful crew. Food apprppriate for the trip. Logistics ok. Balue for money." Pros: "The crew were faultless; looking after your every need - food choices in Business superb. And time for rest." Cons: "Nothing really; maybe just that the A330 seat was a little old with seat controls hard to decipher." Pros: "I liked that they enforced the rule on boarding by rows as many airlines have given up trying to do that and its a free for all especially with certain groups of people." Cons: "Entertainment system and seats are old." Pros: "Crew was very professional. A warm meal was a pleasant surprise on such a short flight." Cons: "Seat too narrow. I was in a bulkhead seat with solid armrests. It was the tightest seat I have ever experienced." Pros: "Loved the journey. It was excellent. Food, service were all good. Comfort of the journey was again excellent." Cons: "There was a 30 minute delay at the gate for boarding which was not announced or informed."
