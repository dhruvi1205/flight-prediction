Business class seats are like the domestic Mint class on Jet Blue. Comfortable but not exceptional. Food is good but not superb. Flight attendants were better on India leg than Miami to Zurich. All India staff was more professional and service oriented. Very polite and service with a smile. Pros: "Great helpful flight crew" Cons: "Checking our bag was a nightmare. All bag check-in was at kiosk which we couldn't use because we had to pay to check our bag. Had to find a desk in another terminal to check bag, then pay an another desk for said checked bag. We saved money by ticketing this way but we almost missed our flight" Pros: "The crew service was very good, as was the food. The only complain is about the entertainment, hope to update the touch screen." Cons: "It’s frustrating to not have the ability to select seats before arriving at check in counter when there’s really not much to choose from." Cons: "Swiss Air from Athens to Zurich stellar—excellent service, seating, food—but left one hour late due to air traffic. Nearly missed connecting Edelweiss flight—and that flight was just terrible. Passengers behind me constantly kicking, pulling my seat—wouldn’t allow me to put seat in recline position." Pros: "Seats very comfortable; real feather pillow! Everything was on time." Cons: "Breakfast consisted only of sweet items -- I didn't touch it." Pros: "Service was fine, on the ground and in the air." Cons: "* Online checkin failed * Sit selection was not honoured * Sit was uncomfortable * Was last to receive luggage after landing, even though they had a "business - priority" sticker on them" Cons: "Check in was annoying in Paris as we had to go to ticket counter, and then go to a different counter to pay for luggage. Annoyed in the first place to have to pay for 2 checked bags on international flight, but to have to go into three separate lines in order to do so was pouring salt into a wound." Cons: "Chose the option with Swiss because it showed that a checked bag was included. Got to the airport and was told to pay up for each checked bag. Great start to the trip." Cons: "missed connection in Zurich because flight left one hour late, and connecting flight didn't wait the extra five minutes which would have allowed us to get on flight. Transfer desk was unable to get us to Bari same day although it was only noon; rebooked for 6:55am next day... Significant financial loss to us." We arrived a few hours early so we had no hiccups. Getting through customs and security are flight left on time and arrived as well on time. Got no complaints I am sorry but.because of the long delay because of the weather I slept through the entire flight Could have offered something to eat for free on such a long flight.. belvita cookies, Sun chips. flight was cancelled at an hour's notice- it appears that when flights are not full, customers are left to fend for themselves. I missed my one and only conference in 6 years, and the 900$ charge was not refundable. Late getting off the plane. Took a very long time to get my luggage. Ended up missing my next flight, had to rebook and get a hotel room. Costed $800 this was a rescheduled connecting flight to the US. We arrived too late from Vancouver to make it through US customs which closed at 8 PM on 5/17. I was booked on an early morning flight on 5/18 with very little sleep prior to boarding. This chicken menu has been for months, I hope AC have their menu change periodically! Previous flight from Orlando to caused a 2 hour delay. Arrived in Montreal and sat on the runway for what seemed like 30 minutes while many people had connections including me. Told that they were not ready for us. At least 2 hours late and not ready. Raced through customs only to find AC309 delayed 3.5 hours. Both flights were caused by plane issues. On top of that from Orlando to Montreal, older plane so no seat screens but pay on credit card for internet. Both trips pay alot for airplane food and I am not a person who can afford to waste money on food that isn't worth the price. No pretzels or nuts. Asked for a coffee once and a tea the next time. Half a cup 3-4 Oz. That gets you the management a zero on the survey. Flight was canceled and we were switched to a time I did not like. Then we were switched to a different airline. Then the flight was a little delayed. Cons: "Were not let off plane after landing for 20 minutes and counting because no ground staff were available to open door to gate."
