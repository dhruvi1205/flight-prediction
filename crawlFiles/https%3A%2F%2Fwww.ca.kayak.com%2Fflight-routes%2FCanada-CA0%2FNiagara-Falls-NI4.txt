Pleasant attendants, timely luggage to carousels.Read more about Air North Service was great from start to finish. Pleasant attendants, timely luggage to carousels. This airline is never a disappointment. Always on time. Short haul from YLW to YYZ , best way to travel. Boarding was fine, and flight was on time. During the flight however, you aren't even offered a drink of water. The carts never leave the galleys. All the attendants said the whole time is take your headphones off and buckle your seatbelt. For the price I wouldn't expect 5 star service, but maybe a drink would have been acceptable Nothing needs to change as it is such a short flight. The employees at the counter when we first arrived were very helpful and kind. The flight attendants were are very pleasant and helpful. I appreciated we departed on time. Pros: "Price was the best over competitors. Many dates available. Staff are friendly and service oriented. Coffee is so good. Food is great. Flight was on time." Cons: "I booked online and then had to rebook - by calling the call centre. Be good to have the ability to change flights online as well. Call centre staff was good - except I assumed she’d book us sitting in the same seats as I had originally chosen (which were available - as I checked online)." Pros: "Service was good, frequent drinks and snacks, nice little deli platter was unexpected and very delicious!" Pros: "You constantly got food and drinks served, a big contrast to the other airlines who don't even serve complimentary food on 5 hour trips. We didn't expect to get food on this 2 hour flight so we had breakfast beforehand. We were pleasantly surprised!" Pros: "Friendly staff. Provided sandwich and cookie during flight." Cons: "Minor item: Didn't provide hav charger in seats but for short flights not a big issue" Pros: "From the coffee and cookies while waiting to board to the freshly baked items given while receiving food service, this is great customer service. Not to mention the competitively priced airfare and not having to pay an extra fee for checked bags, this airline can't be beat. I would definitely fly it again and suggest it to anyone if they're looking to fly in northern Canada." I liked when we actually were allowed to get on the airplane back to Edmonton… What could’ve been better well, not having our flight be delayed five hours could’ve been better… And then canceling our flight from Edmonton to Toronto, and then rescheduling us to fly from Honolulu to Edmonton -Edmonton to Vancouver, and then Vancouver to Toronto with a 12 hour layover in Edmonton pretty much was hell… Total travel time to get home 38 hours that’s really what could’ve been better. The two gate attendants for WestJet in Honolulu told us to come back to the gate to try to make other arrangements because they had to board the Calgary flight 1st and they didn’t have time to talk to me but by the time I came back when they told us to they said you should’ve come earlier to make these arrangements everyone else already changed their flights… We found out later that 30 people did not get on the 2:30 AM Edmonton flight. They ended up getting on the midnight flight to Calgary and making other arrangements to Toronto and so forth which we could’ve taken advantage of that if they had allowed us to when I initially had went up and approached the two gate attendance one of their names was Denise. One of the kindest WestJet employee was the one who received us in Edmonton, who felt so bad about the entire situation she got us for more meal vouchers and flew us first class from Vancouver to Toronto. In Honolulu they had given us two vouchers to use for dinner and they weren’t valid outside of Canada so we had purchased a meal and they were completely useless… But nowhere did it say that they could only be used in Canada So when we received more food vouchers in Edmonton, all of them did end up working in Canada, but it was just so convoluted. Overall, we have traveled to other countries even going as far as Africa… and that experience was far easier than flying to Hawaii from Canada I cannot believe any of this happened and how inconvenient it was We arrived, exhausted after 38 hours of travel, and could not even go to work on Monday. I look forward to hearing from KAYAK or from WestJet for some sort of compensation over the situation. Understood that Premium domestic passengers had access to the Plaza Lounge at Winnipeg, James Richardson Airport. Not the case. Not a good start to the trip. Generally fly Business Class on Air Canada which includes access to the Maple Leaf Lounge. All future flights will be with Air Canada. Plane left on time. The service and food was excellent. No problem with the luggage arrived and was delivered within 15 minutes. Not a tonne of food for purchase items for early morning. Absolutely horrible service filled with delays and problems will never travel with Flair Airlines and WestJet delays delays and mor delays absolutely Horrible customer service and Really Experience. There wasn’t an option for not applicable under food. No food on this flight. Good coffee though. Pros: "Very little" Cons: "Rough weather. Stopped delivering water and snacks. Seat belt off and no attempt to continue water and snacks for 20 minutes. Then started back at front again to those who had already been served once. When got to me no snacks offered. Had to ask." Cons: "The food could have been better. I don’t mind paying but some nicer, healthier choices would have been nice. It is airplane food so no real surprise. :)" Pros: "The crew was very patient to get all the passengers' needs from gate-to-gate. The flight was very smooth, landing to takeoff, and arrived on-time!" Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "If the flight just got cancelled from the get-go and if the airline reimbursed us or gave us flight credit." New jet. Lots of leg room. On time departure. Early arrival. Reasonable airfare. Excellent online experience. I had checked in online the day before but was instructed to collect our boarding passes when we arrived. I am not completely comfortable using the automated Kiosks and always enjoy the nostalgia of speaking with someone when checking in for a flight. Upon doing so however, we were immediately asked,"did you check in online already?" To which I replied, "yes, but we were asked to retrieve our boarding passes upon arrival." She then said, "that's what those machines over there are for. We really encourage people to use those." That unfortunately sparked a series of shortness and overall poor behavior in my opinion from the woman who checked us in. I understand it was early in the morning but I am always excited to experience flying and that interaction has unfortunately left a bitter taste in my mouth to the point I will forever now hesitate to book with Porter again. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Cheers, JD Everything was fantastic, by far the best airline experience in Canada 🇨🇦! Porter uses the intelligent and logical way of boarding a plane - from the back. Nothing , two weeks of dealing with booking glitches on porters side , as our main international carrier was fine ,we were assured. When we got to check in everything would be smooth , we were confirmed there would be no issues, guess what happened? After an hour and a half at check inn we were told there was technical glitch involving payment we may not be able to fly , which would have set off a catastrophic chain , the undue stress on my family was unbearable . They really communicated well advised well in advance of a delay. Contacted to tell me it was almost time to go and to do a check in. Porter, like most airlines, need to improve their baggage policies. In reality, there are no longer 'cheap flights' because passengers pay exorbitant baggage fees. Pros: "Originally: a low fare" Cons: "Flight oversold, travelers bumped. Flight delayed while they kicked people off the flight." Pros: "Great value. Free beverages including a small selection of beer, wine and whiskey. Otherwise no frills, no with, no entertainment. Short haul flights, no problem. Best bargain airline" Cons: "There is a fee to change your assigned seat US$10-20(?), regardless of whether it's a "better" seat. Fortunately, this trip our seats (family of three) were near where we wanted to be. But, it would have been disappointing to have to pay for each seat change for each leg, each way." Pros: "The crew was good and boarding was super efficient" Cons: "No entertain on the plane. Since when YTZ offered no more complimentary drinks and some snack?" Pros: "Crew was accommodating and kept me and my family comfortable in the flight. Food was good" Cons: "Free stuff like headphones and blanket which can be collected at the end of the flight" Cons: "To have known that you had to do security twice without leaving the boarding area." Cons: "Exit seat wasnt a full exit seat just a slightly larger row and did not recline. Seats were smaller than usual too." Pros: "Loved the extra leg room." Cons: "Food was horrible, had two bites and didn’t eat the rest." Pros: "There was not much to like... we boarded quickly that was about it." Cons: "For starters, they should offer water and juice on all flights. On my outbound trip they only offered water and it took them a long time to offer the water. Also, on my inbound trip they turned on the lights after take off and had them on for a while. Seats are also SMALL." Pros: "It’s hard to write a review when flight was supposed to leave at 6:30 and didn’t until midnight, but due to weather. It was frustrating for all but staff and pilot kept us informed at all times so that was appreciated. There wasn’t much to do but to wait out the weather." Cons: "For the weather to be better and to have left on time - but obviously that is out of everyone’s control." Cons: "Flught was 90 mins late leaving becuse of equipment failure. Missed my meeting." Pros: "Price" Cons: "It took almost an hour from landing for our luggage to make it to the belt. For a domestic flight, this is really poor." Pros: "It left fairly promptly. Service was efficient. The seat was comfortable." Cons: "flight was delayed in both directions; very few announcements; the crew were ok, but there was not much service in the hour we waited foe the plane to take off and during the flight" Flight left late so arrived late in Toronto flight staff were great. Got me off the plane quickly to try and make customs and my flight to Atlanta got to my next flight in time but they said they decided to put my luggage on a later flight so now I would have to wait since they said I would have to be on the plane with my luggage so waited another 4 hours to make that flight. We had delayed flight and I arrived 2 hrs late But I got safety destiny Unfriendly staff, delayed flight, luggage took almost an hour. Very disappointing. Seats were comfortable. There were multiple delays in the flight. I ordered Vegan food, and they didn't bring it, and the pilot was horrible. he had difficulties with landing. The flight got cancelled at midnight, no flight alternatives for the day of my trip. Got stuck in Montreal and ended up having to pay for a hotel. A long international flight and not even a snack? Really? One drink in five hours? Really? Flight delayed and baggage claim in Toronto took almost an hour They overbooked the flight and out myself and my friends on standby which created unnecessary stress for the next day and a half which ruined the end of our trip I did not complete a booking with kayak for this trip so cannot rate Multiple delays, multiple gate changes, disorderly boarding, no carry-on baggage room, few snacks, small dinner, small seats, no ventilation and etc. You are treated poorly if in economy class.
