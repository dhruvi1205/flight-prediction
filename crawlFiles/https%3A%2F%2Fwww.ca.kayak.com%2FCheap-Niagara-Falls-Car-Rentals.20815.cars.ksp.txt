KAYAK’s top tips for renting a car in Niagara Falls Niagara Falls is a city worth visiting for anyone, with stunning natural panoramas and a bustling Old Town with modern architecture. You'll have the chance to sightsee at the Niagara Ledge, Fort Niagara State Park, Niagara Glen Nature Resource, Niagara Falls State Park, and Three Sister Island. The places you can visit in and outside the city are virtually unlimited. But you’ll need a convenient means of transportation to explore these destinations. Many of the region’s best sights are far apart, making public transportation unreliable. Car rentals in Niagara Falls offer the most convenient and reliable means of getting to your destinations. You can visit attractions like Casa Loma, which is about 70 km (43 miles) from the city of Niagara Falls. En route to Niagara Falls, your final flight might land at John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport (YHM). The car-rental agencies at the airport include Sunnycars, Avis, Hertz, Budget, Discount, Europcar, National, and Enterprise. All the rental providers have desks in the baggage-claim area, and the airport offers complimentary shuttle services to the car-rental facilities. Consider pre-booking to avoid the sometimes-long lines at the airport rental desks. Thanks to well-established roads, driving your car rentals in Niagara Falls is generally a safe, easy, and enjoyable experience. Drivers here are less impatient and usually follow the traffic laws. So, when driving your rental car in Niagara Falls, be sure to abide by all the traffic laws yourself. Be particularly mindful of speed limits, roundabouts, and alleys. The city has a zero-tolerance policy for drinking and driving. Therefore, you shouldn't have any alcohol in your system when driving your Niagara Falls car rentals. Like other cities in Canada, Niagara Falls experiences more traffic during rush hour, since most residents drive to the city in their private vehicles, causing more traffic buildup.

I liked the car we had. Cons:The drop off in Toronto was horrible. We had to keep driving around the block in downtown until we spied a teeny tiny sign that said enterprise. Once in the parking ramp it was really confusing where to go to drop off the car. I am still concerned that I am going to check my credit card statement and find a charge for the parking ramp.

Instead, we were only offered a Jeep Compass which is quite inferior to the RAV4. The return was okay except we arrived just past the closing time due to road closures in Quebec City. The attendant was closing out for the day but said we would get a credit statement sent to our email address. None has been received to date. 2.0 Poor Sep. 2023My car that I reserved was never rents to me . No person at the Hertz counter , when I arrived at the airport . Nothing .

I really don’t like taking taxis. 9.6 Wonderful Nov. 2019 Pros:Staff was very friendly and helpful. Pickup and drop off very convenient. Cons:I wish the car rental prices were not sooooo expensive!!!! 4.8 Mediocre Oct. 2019 Pros:No line up at counter Cons:I did not feel I got the car I paid for. Our original plans were to be travelling with four people all with large suitcases. Website provided the indication I was to receive a fullsize luxury vehicle. A Chrysler 300 or similar. It ended up being only the two of us. What I received was a very small crammed Cadillac XT SUV. It would have seated four small people comfortably, It only held our two suitcases and definitely would not have accommodated us as per our original booking. I questioned why we were being a given such a small car (small SUV) at the counter at time of pick up and the representative looked at me with a disgusted look and said "It is a Cadillac !!", to make me feel like I should be ashamed and that I was wrong to ask for the larger luxury vehicle that I booked. If it was a Cadillac Escalade, a Lincoln Navigator or any vehicle similar in size to a Chrysler 300 I would have been perfectly fine. When I walked out to the parking lot, the Hertz section had only five vehicles, all small cars and our small SUV. We would have had a serious problem if it was the two couples as per our original travel plans. With no other vehicles in the lot any further discussion or argument on the matter would have bee futile. We loaded our two suitcases (1 large and 1 medium size) in the back, as they just barely fit and drove off with mindset that I had been taken advantage of and that I just had to put up with it.

When the staff member came back in from inspecting the car he claimed there was a stone chip in the windshield. I asked him to show me because I did not see anything. He pointed to a bug splatter. We argued but it didn't matter. I wrote a claim saying that I disagreed. I am concerned that some crazy charge is going to end up on my card that is not valid. Worst car rental experience I have ever had. 2.0 Poor Apr. 2022They gave me a car that wasn't cleaned or disinfected. I found a rental agreement and covid mask from last renter in center console of rental car. Took picture of contents of center console...covid mask/paperwork. And I still have the rental agreement from last renter. This is not the time to skip cleaning (COVID). Website states special cleaning??????? I had my elderly mother in car the first day. Would have never let her into rental if Id known at that time it wasnt cleaned..Brought this to their attention when dropping off car and they said call customer service like it was a non issue. I have have a open complaint with avis.
