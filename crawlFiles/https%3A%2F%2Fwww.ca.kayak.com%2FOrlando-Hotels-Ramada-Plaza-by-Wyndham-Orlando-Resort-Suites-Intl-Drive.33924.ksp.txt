Sink handle fell of whilr washing my hands. Maintenance came in and put it back on telling me not to move it so much. There is no fan in the bathroom and parts of the celing and starting to come off. The AC unit is also extremely loud and does not cool the room. Be sure to request the new building cause the old one is terrible.

We were moved to another room a few doors down in the middle of the night without even an apology from the staff. I brought it up to the front desk staff the next day and was completely blown off. I sent an email and the response was "Guest complaint. Have a wonderful day!" This hotel clearly has no interest in the well-being or comfort of it's guests. With so many other hotel options in Orlando, stay far, far away from this one!! D 4.2 Mediocre dpotenz25, Jun. 2015 Cons:Dirty hotel room, mold in shower and bathroom ceiling, carpets were stained, half the light bulbs in room were out. Ice machine was empty.
