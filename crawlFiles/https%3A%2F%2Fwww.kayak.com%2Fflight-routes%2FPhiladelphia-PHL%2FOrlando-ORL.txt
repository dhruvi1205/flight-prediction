Cons: "The entertainment display in my seat did not work." Pros: "Snacks and new interior on A320" Cons: "Almost 4 hour delay and no Wi-Fi. When I complained to JetBlue I received a pathetic $15 credit." Cons: "It was cold in the flight and Tvs didn’t work due to satellite coverage" Pros: "Crew was amazing. It was the pilot’s last flight before retirement, so it was fun celebrating with him and the crew. Seats were comfortable." Pros: "The crew was ok." Cons: "We wait too much, at least someone should have told the reasons for the waiting." Cons: "Absolutely perfect from departure to arrival. Our first time flying jet blue and it was incredible" Pros: "Flight was on time, extra room seats were very comfortable." Cons: "The flight was bumpy but I think the pilot did all he could" Pros: "Crew handled a health situation very well. Never lost their composure." Cons: "Not having our luggage lost" Pros: "Boarding was great and on-time. Flight took a bit longer due to the weather." Cons: "Couldn't understand any of the in-flight announcements. My in-flight entertainment didn't work right." Pros: "Boarding process need to be improved. Seat assignment is horrible" Cons: "It could have left on time or they could have told us they weren’t leaving and let us get some sleep." Pros: "chwcking in was very easy." Cons: "No in board beverages. On flight from RDU to PHL beverages were served." Cons: "We had to wait at the customs for nearly 1.5hrs, then pick up our luggage, then check in again!!! We were running and got on the plane 10 mins before the departure. Super stressful!!" Pros: "I think they flew so fast. We could land almost on time even though we departed a hour late. Airplane was new and clean." Cons: "Boarding was chaos. They overbooked 25? 45? Anyway, they are in panic. They tried to request ppl to take next day flight by giving away 300 gift card etc. the ppl who were told there are no seats upset and arguing at the gate. Flight was delayed for one hour. Once we are on airplane, they are still shuffling seats around, so ppl cannot move forward. Just standing there for 10mins waiting for things to settle. Flight attendants did not give us a headphone. (I have a headphone for iPhone X so I could not connect it to their entertaiment system.)" Pros: "Everything went as smoothly as possible. Not a hiccup. Great price, great flight, great experience!" Pros: "Delta provided great entertainment options and it felt like endless food and drinks. The seats were also a bit more spacious than usual" Pros: "The exit row seat on this leg out of PHL to SLC did recline! No need for Delta Comfort+ unless you want to get off of the plane ... faster." Cons: "For some reason, the pilot couldn't figure out how to adjust the cabin temperature for the first hour or so. This made the flight (and I was sitting in an exit row seat, right by the door which is usually cooler) uncomfortably hot and muggy. Food? No food. Thank goodness for Delta Lounge (even if it was the one in PHL). Just snacks make this a poor option for many. I don't know what is up, but the USB charger on the two monitors didn't work and neither did the outlet between the seats. And I have two different sets of cables "just in case" and they're the 3-in-1 so I can try to charge multiple devices (Apple, Android and Samsung) but nothing worked." Pros: "I enjoyed my flight! Great movies, good food and I was comfortable. Nothing like First Class." Cons: "My toddler daughter became ill before departure and the crew was awful. They failed to provide me with hardly anything besides 2 blankets and a few remoistened hand wipes to clean up vomit and was very rude when I asked to change seats, even though there were at least 8 other seats open on the flight." Pros: "Seats weren’t too bad, the plane was clean, and the crew was nice." Cons: "Our flight kept getting delayed due to paper work AFTER we boarded. There were also a lot of people on the plane and no social distancing." Cons: "They cancelled two of my flights in one weekend. We will not use American Airlines again." Pros: "The seating and leg room was comfortable." Cons: "Since my ticket was "basic" I was put in the last boarding group and given a middle seat; my mother was also in a middle seat. Once boarded I noticed everyone around me was separated from their families--to the point where a baby was transferred 3 times over my head between the parents!" Pros: "The flight was early to arrive. There was also a rather frightening bit of turbulence, and the pilot explained why it had occurred, which I found very reassuring." Cons: "The food was definitely below average. It's virtually all carbohydrates.Other airlines provide you with a printed description of the menu options, so it's easier to make a choice. "Chicken or pasta" doesn't give the passengers any idea of what they are actually choosing. This time the chicken dish was served with pearl couscous, so it was basically pasta as well. The salad I was given was brown and wilted, and while the cabin attendants were kind enough to give me two salad that were in better shape (after meal service), I just think that quality control should have prevented a inedible salad from being served in the first place. I am also extremely opposed to American Airlines Transatlantic luggage fees. Since I was moving abroad rather than taking a short trip, I was not pleased about paying 100 USD for a second bag on top of an already expensive flight." Pros: "I slept the entire way because our flight was delayed and This was a connection flight for me but had now slept all day!!" Pros: "Basic flight. Super uncomfortable seats. Older plane. Cramped. Pilot was great. Flight smooth." Cons: "Got there safe!" Cons: "American has lost my bags multiple times and always has delays. They’re domestic planes are dirty and run down. Not a preferred airline for me." Pros: "Overall a good flight" Cons: "The boarding at phl continues to be the stuff of nightmares. Get organized PHL!!" Pros: "It made for a interesting Christmas but not a very jolly one." Cons: "The flight staff skipped my aile a few times on accident. The touchscreen didnt worl very well, they offed free headphones but my headphone jack was broke and all of the usb charger ports didnt work in my row there werent many new choices for entertainment. And the food was interesting I'll give it that." Cons: "We arrived in Amsterdam at 9am, after traveling two hours to get there. We found out right away that there was a delay and chances of missing the connecting flight from Philadelphia to Orlando were great. We requested a different booking to insure travel to Orlando, which was denied. So the connecting flight was missed and after hours arrived in Orlando at midnight. Missed my ride and all car rentals were booked. All this caused a lot of anxiety and unnecessary stress. Very disappointing. And to add to it, the flight itself was horrible and there was no entertainment available for the entire flight." Pros: "It got me where I needed to go" Cons: "So crowded, seats uncomfortable, wifi not working completely, screaming children." Cons: "The flight was delayed more than 4 hours. It was a bad experience with United." Pros: "Having a direct flight across the country was a good thing. That was about the only positive, well that & we did land safely." Cons: "Ticket agent said I could take my bag on the plane. Gate agent told me my bag not I were going on the plane unless I paid $50 to put the bag below if I wanted to get in the plane. Very matter of fact & rude. I was just about the last person they let board so there really wasn't a chance to discuss with them. No WiFi on a cross country plane, lame. No access to the headrest video screen w/o paying for it, lame. Snotty unconcerned flight attendants as well. Overall one of the worst flights I've had in memory. I would pay more next time to fly another airline." Pros: "Everything! The flight left on time and landed early. Service was great and the staff was super." Pros: "Landing safely." Cons: "Everything else. I flew from PHL to IAH and was very unhappy with the experience. The gate agents were unfriendly. The bag check agents downstairs were unfriendly. I had two separate phone calls with United a week prior to the flight to understand and confirm the bag policy. This was AFTER booking my flight so they knew upfront I bought a basic economy ticket. After my first call, I understood a personal item would be free and I would be able to pay for my carry on bag, but only within 24 hours prior to the flight. I made a second call to be absolutely sure the previous agent gave me the correct information and pricing. So I paid the $25 for my carry on, checked in online, and waited at the gate while boarding at the very end because I was basic economy. They did not let me board with my bag. They requested another $50 to check my carry on with them or I would be rebooked. I struggled to afford the flight, let alone the carry on fee I had paid in advance. I literally did not have the money, and even if I had the cash, they only accept plastic. What blew me away was they weren't asking me to check my carry on because of the size. But because of my basic economy ticket, aka, the N fare. Despite checking with two employees by phone after buying my ticket and paying for a carry on in advance, there is a rule in place that states "if you have purchased Basic Economy, you will only be allowed one personal item, unless you are a Premier member or a primary card member using a qualifying MileagePlus credit card." Therefore, there is no alternative. You are a second class citizen; a no good deplorable, when you buy this ticket and there is nothing you can do to upgrade it. Only the "premier" passengers have the right to bring a carry on aboard even if you think you're paying for the privelage. What I was expected to somehow understand after asking two United employees prior if I could purchase the right to bring a carry on bag aboard, was to CHECK my CARRY ON downstairs or learn the hard way. Wow. What a ruthless way to learn this lesson. I waited 7 more hours to board the next available flight. What a nightmare. I thought I had did the appropriate research necessary and planned in advance to avoid these situations. Checking in online and contacting customer service prior is no longer the convenience it used to be. Even if you've done your research, bring additional funds with you. Even if you check in online and have a digital boarding pass, always check in with a real human prior to entering the TSA security line. A side note, United is trying to save money while "speeding up" the process by forcing you to use a computer to hand over your checked luggage. Speaking with a human now is a monumental struggle." Pros: "Clean aircraft, swift flight" Cons: "Seat was changed to last row/middle seat (not what initially booked or confirmed with online check-in). Before takeoff, attendant moved all passengers in back row to alternate seats. Which meant that I was no longer traveling with my colleague. Unfortunately, that made our intended meeting time impossible." Pros: "I slept through whole way. So it was fabulous. Clean and fast trip." Pros: "Although the flight was cancelled due to the hurricane i got my money back." Cons: "I was thoroughly disappointed when I realized that I had to pay to get any type of entertainment on the in-flight screen. That feels like zero effort on the part of the airline to make my flight enjoyable." Cons: "After United made me miss my connecting flight, I got an alternate flight to a different airport, but not apology, no offer to upgrade, nothing. Already frustrated, and with my knees hitting the seat in front of me because the seats are too close together, a flight attendant scolded me when I dared put my leg in the aisle (which I often do on other airlines without incident). Once on the ground, I went straight to United's baggage office to see if my bag had followed me, and encountered two of the rudest people, cutting me off whenever I said anything more than they needed to enter into their computer. If your job is in customer service, be friendly, apologize when things go wrong, understand that your customers are your reason for being in business, and be helpful." Cons: "Spent the whole flight listening to the front flight attendants complain loudly and publicly about one of the rear flight attendants. I understand someone was doing something wrong, but it was like watching a very dull and petty soap opera" Pros: "I arrived safely. The crew was very friendly and helped to. All my husband who was scared as this was his first time flying." Cons: "The agent who checked me in was extremely unprofessional. I felt like she was envious that I was going on a vacation and she had to work. She tried to make my experience a living hell. I personally think she should be fired. She does not enjoy what she is doing. She joyfully told me that it costs $40 to carry my luggage and after I informed her that I saw it online for less she informed me that I should have bought it online. She then stuck me all the way in the last row of the plane. I am 5'9". My husband is 6'2" and over 300 pounds. Those seats have the least leg room. It was pure torture. The flight crew in the back help my poor husband by using humor to help him." Cons: "The fact that you charged $60 for carry over on. Why would I fly with this airline again when at least on most other airlines I don't pay for carry on?" Pros: "I thought the crew was very nice, seats were comfortable although many may not agree. There is more legroom since the chairs are thinner and lighter." Cons: "Didn't realize there was a carry-on fee which is my own fault but will cost you minimum of 70 round trip. It is hard Tom figure it out in their site however. For that cost they should at least have wifi on the plane which they do not." Pros: "Frontier has been great so far. The walkway seems more narrow than other airlines but that must help with comfort / legroom in the seats. For the price, I will definitely be using Frontier for quick trips again!" Cons: "I didn't like a 3.5 hour delay but I don't fault Frontier for that. I can't think of any particular Frontier thing I disliked. The engine / plane sounded very loud, not really sure what that was all about." Pros: "The flight" Cons: "It's been a man hour and 45 minutes and my luggage (as well as many other passengers) has not come out the baggage claim. The loud speaker has asked for a frontier baggage rep to come but nobody is here. I am missing my carpool to my second destination in florida and have to cancel/forfeit my return ticket. This is very disappointing and not the service one should expect." Cons: "The seats couldn't recline plus they were very uncomfortable to be in." Pros: "Courteous staff and easy boarding on he brand new plane!" Cons: "You have to pay for any food or drink on the plane." Pros: "Boarding and getting off the plane was very smooth. Also the pilot did a great job with take off and landing was so smooth I was impressed." Cons: "I didn't like that they didn't offer any snacks or drinks other than water complimentary. I mean a soft drink shouldn't run someone four dollars after paying for a ticket. Other than that it was a nice flight." Cons: "Did not realize they charged $45 for each carry-on and how hard (no padding at all) the seats were. For the extra $190 I spent, I would have rather flown AA or any other airline that is not a discount airline.
