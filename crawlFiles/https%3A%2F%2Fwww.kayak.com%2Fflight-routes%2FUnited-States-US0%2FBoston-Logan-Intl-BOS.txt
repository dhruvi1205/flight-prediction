This has become a norm in southwest tobhave every flight very late As usual was very late. This has become a norm in southwest tobhave every flight very late Flight was delayed but they still boarded us early knowing we were delayed. Were not able to move about the plane the majority of the flight. Cons: "COVID survey at gate as we were called for boarding by group required us to be pulled out of "A" group to fill out survey that was done one person at a time on electronic tablet that we were last to be allowed to board aircraft.

While I like having the entertainment screens provided, since I had a nice device to watch films, it was very pleasant. A couple of good films were available." Cons: "I don't understand why the people who get seats in the rear of the plane have to board last. Not only do they have the discomfort of waiting to get on the plane and sitting in the back, but there is no room for carry on luggage by the time they get on. It seems like a double whammy." Cons: "I was not notified that my card was declined and this caused a ton of delays" Pros: "The crew were friendly, and the seating were uncomfortably hard. Seat pitch weren’t as great. Mood lighting were nice." Cons: "More comfortable seat, offer a meal service since it is “transcontinental”."

I tried checking in each day without any information such as give it up you suck and you’re going to get the worst seed no better how much you try to avoid it…" Cons: "The flight was oversold and my husband did not have a seat assignment.

I was traveling to San Diego to meet my family for the weekend - I would’ve been in severe trouble had I missed the flight. Thanks Alaska!!" Pros: "We left on time and arrived early with a smooth landing" Plane is old and seats are worn. Add to it the plane was dirty. No plugs for laptop. Normalize good food and crew with a better than mediocre attitude. Could have been ON TIME! A big Jet Blue failing- never on time. Get organized people!!!! Seat was surprisingly comfortable and roomy. I like the onboard “pantry”. Lavatory was kept very clean. Flight was delayed over 5 hours.

Pros: "Crew was very kind and entertainment was good when available" Cons: "WiFi in all flights" Cons: "Virgin Atlantic has had better days. Living off of a long gone reputation. Great staff but old and worn out planes. Code sharing has done them no favors!" Pros: "Flight itself was fine. Captain was very communicative about rough air. 757-300's are amazingling noisy; recommend headphones for a relaxing flight." Cons: "Could not login to Delta app at MCO to show boarding pass. Had to return to a kiosk to print paper passes. Very aggravating but lesson learned to always have a paper backup. Boarding was disorganized and not by priority. Gate agents allowed passengers bull rush the gate and allowed line cuts. They lost control." Pros: "Crew was amazing with my baby. Overall a very good flight." Cons: "Canceling flights with no notice and rescheduling made me lose a day" Cons: "The same flight leaving an hour and a half after ours left before ours.
