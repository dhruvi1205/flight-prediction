Pros: "Crew was nice. Seat was broken for recliner." Cons: "Having parents with infants board with or after those needing assistance. It was an inconvenience having a fussy infant wait in a long line. We had bassinet seats so boarding first would not have slowed the seating process." Pros: "The comfort of the plane" Cons: "The staff at Atlanta International Airport were terrible; not customer friendly. The supervisor at the check-in counter needs to be replaced. I am not one of your frequent flyers but travel internationally. However, based on his attitude I will think twice to select Qatar as my choice of airlines." Pros: "Crew was amazing and food was Delicious as compare to other airlines." Cons: "There should be add more variety for toddler food/breakfast.As they served the same food which is for adult.

Pros: "Cabin crew attentive, cabin quiet, seats comfortable, rest rooms clean." Cons: "Hot food was luke warm, portions skimpy." Pros: "Friendly service with smile." Cons: "Weight restrictions for carry on. I had a computer backpack along with a carry on bag which I have always taken with me on other airlines but it was not so here without paying extra charge for it." Not exceptional but all good. Business class seats are like the domestic Mint class on Jet Blue. Comfortable but not exceptional. Food is good but not superb. Flight attendants were better on India leg than Miami to Zurich. All India staff was more professional and service oriented. Very polite and service with a smile. Pros: "The crew was amazing. They left snacks and drinks out in between service." Pros: "The crew was nice, the food was really good, the plane was clean, and they used reusable silverware and plates to avoid waste." Pros: "All great!"

Tricky to have that elbow rest, it is you or your neighbor!" Pros: "Check in agent was extremely helpful in expediting both me and my bags after a late check-in. Flight attendants very friendly and helpful, food excellent. If Swiss Air flew everywhere I need to go, I would fly them every time!" Pros: "The crew was friendly and polite." Cons: "The plane was small, it rattled and shook a lot and the size of the seats is ridiculous. The bathrooms did not have warm water and the sense of comfort is to be found only in business and first class. We fly to Zurich a lot because we have family there and we always take SWISS for a direct flight. They have old planes, the little TVs by the seats may or may not work and although the crew is nice and well trained, they cannot substitute for the discomfort of 10 hours flights in a crammed place. Sorry SWISS." Pros: "The business class ground crew proposed to check in our hand baggage and were very helpful. (We were in economy class) It was my birthday and i was very touched to receive a spontaneously made card and some chocolate truffles and a smile from the flight crew." Cons: "I think the choice of films could be improved." I didn’t like that I had to be pulled aside to be searched in front of people like a criminal.

Cons: "Nothing" Pros: "Staff was very friendly, the plane was very clean. Loved the entire trip, except for our uncontrollable weather delay." Cons: "Nothing" Cons: "The flight was delayed because one or more of the crew were late. I would suggest that when you board a large flight, start from the rear of the plane, not the front. Having to go past everyone to get to your seat is time consuming and somewhat stressful. The food was super gross. The so called beef bulgogi was not appetizing at all. For breakfast, the food was disgusting." Pros: "On a quick 40 minute flight they still managed to serve coffee, water and snacks." Cons: "Seats are terrible - need replacing-worn out; say like Queen Latina, setting on top of one another; absolutely no leg room!" Pros: "We actually did not fly this route. We bought a car and drove home!" Pros: "The short duration of the flight and punctual arrival. Better seating with more leg space in Airbus than in the horrible Boeing 467- 400."

Nobody understands acoustically which zone is being boarded ( not only a Delta issue)." Pros: "Got me there Safely" Cons: "Couldn’t understand announcements... at all! By flight attendant or pilot" Cons: "There was no food or entertainment. There was a problem with the seat of the person in front of me. He couldn't keep his seat straight and his head was in my lap throughout the flight." Pros: "Great crew" Cons: "Wi-Fi not working or hard to get to work. Flight was delayed by an hour and service was very rushed." Cons: "The flight was delayed 75 min because the plane wouldnt start. A differernt aircraft was needed to resume ops." Cons: "No food, just snacks and no place close to the gate to eat." Cons: "We were late, no TV screens, bad food and I can go on and on" Pros: "Flight between Atlanta to Istanbul was good with ample leg space." Cons: "Food variety could be better. Also for a family of 4, the only option I had was to sit in group of 2. vs all 4 together ." Pros: "Nice plane , nice crew. Ok food , not as good as Sfo to Ist ."
