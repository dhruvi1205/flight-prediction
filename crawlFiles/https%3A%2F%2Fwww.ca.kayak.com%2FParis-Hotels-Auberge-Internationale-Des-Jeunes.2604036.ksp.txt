Highly recommend it. L 7.7 Good Luke, Oct. 2017 Pros:Easy, good location, free breakfast, friendly staff. Overall excellent value Cons:Showers a bit old school and no showering after 23h. Easy check in and friendly staff. Good breakfast, you can have it to take away as well. A 7.1 Good Anonymous, Sep. 2017 Pros:The location and price! Also the people were all friendly so it's great if you want to meet new people. Free breakfast is also a plus. I had the luck of having a bathroom/shower inside a four people mix gendered room, which is very convenient. They also included safes inside the room. Cons:The comfort level of the bed and the cleanliness here needs work. But you get what you paid for! Set your expectations appropriately and you'll be fine. A 7.1 Good Anonymous, Jan. 2017 Pros:Comfortable bed, neat free breakfast( in the morning, this guy, I think it might be the manager or owner, was there to serve and accommodate us with the breakfast, I could tell he really cares about a good service, I really appreciate that), free combination small metal safe in the room for each peroson(good for storing passport, wallet or other small valuables), relatively good location, close to a small market(opens til pretty late) Cons:No sink in the toilet (can't wash hands after using the toilet). The lighting in the room is not very inviting, also didn't find a individual bed head light. It took really long to check-in ( I stood there for 25+ minutes to be checked in) Location 10 Rue Trousseau, 75011 Paris What's nearby Place des Vosges1.1 km Cimetière du Père-Lachaise1.6 km Notre Dame2.1 km Centre Pompidou2.2 km Sainte-Chapelle2.5 km Pont Neuf2.8 km Luxembourg Gardens3.1 km Louvre Museum3.3 km Parc des Buttes-Chaumont3.3 km Musée d’Orsay3.9 km Jardins des Tuileries4 km Place Vendôme4 km Policies Check-in/Check-out Check in anytime after 3:00 PM, check out anytime before 11:00 AM Cancellation/prepayment Cancellation/prepayment policies vary by room type and provider.
