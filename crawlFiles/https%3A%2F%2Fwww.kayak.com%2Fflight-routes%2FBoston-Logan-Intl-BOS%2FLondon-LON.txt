Cons: "I had significant delays on both the flight to Logan & the flight back to Charlotte." Cons: "The headphone jack.was worn out, so the audio was sporadic." Pros: "Crew was nice and accommodating. Plenty of leg room in regular cabin. Good entertainment options.?" Pros: "so easy. thank you for having Starbucks in the DCA and BOS terminals. got text msgs about delays and all smooth!" Pros: "This older airplane has lots of room. And has free TV and movies on domestic flights on all seats." Cons: "However an older plane does not have touch screens and movie choice is limited." Pros: "Boarding was great and on-time. Flight took a bit longer due to the weather." Cons: "Couldn't understand any of the in-flight announcements. My in-flight entertainment didn't work right." Pros: "I've been flying budget airlines for so long that I was almost shocked to fly an airline that actually cares about its passengers! I kid you not, when they offered coffee to all passengers, I was so sure they would charge us I turned it down. Then, I noticed no one else was paying for it. The next time free snacks and drinks came around, I made sure to grab some! I also appreciated the few extra inches of leg room in every row. Being 6'3", not many planes are designed with your comfort in mind. I fit fairly comfortably in a non-emergency row seat. Last time I flew to Baltimore for work, I had a terrible experience with a different airline. It was $200 less expensive than most airlines, but I ended up paying more in baggage fees and seats. It was only a 1 hour flight and My boss said, "Cheap things usually cost you more, in money, time, and emotion" and nothing has been truer. I always assumed that flights were always unpleasant experiences. Now, I know better." Cons: "The seats, while having more than average leg room, still weren't very comfortable. Not that I'm expecting a luxury experience while flying economy, but I felt as though the headrest was farther back than average. I can usually fall asleep on a plane and wake up without neck pain, but I really struggled to even figure out a relaxing position this time around. I also did not know that JetBlue did not serve meals on cross-country flights. Or, on any flights for that matter. Had I known, I probably would've picked up a breakfast sandwich before boarding." Pros: "There was a weather delay and we were kept informed. Communications from the pilots were able to be understood. Best ever in that regard." Pros: "The crew members were great- really friendly and accommodating." Cons: "Turbulence. But like... nobody can make that stop so basically it was perfect" Cons: "Had to pick up gate-checked bag at carousel. But it arrived quickly." Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "Entertainment didn’t work, the crew did nothing to help. The plane was hot and stuffy. My luggage is lost." Pros: "The crew service was very good, as was the food. The only complain is about the entertainment, hope to update the touch screen." Cons: "I asked the Chinese flight attendant in economy to please ask the man in front of me to put his seat up since the captain and purser had already asked us to do so in three languages The man in front of me refused to do so. She said she was going to start at the front of the plane and let him leave his seat back making it difficult to see my tv monitor. I thought that she should’ve said that it was time to put your seat up. It was frustrating that she didn’t support me and the request of the captain. Your seats are very uncomfortable upright when the person in front of you has their seat back." Pros: "On time; smooth boarding process; lights dimmed for a reasonably long time." Cons: "NO legroom on the Zurich to Dusseldorf flight." Pros: "On time arrival" Cons: "Boston -Zurich, the most uncomfortable seat possible. I am 5’2 and I barely fit.... Seats are way more comfortable on European flights." Cons: "The temperature on this overnight flight was sweltering Legroom was poor" Pros: "We were pleasantly surprised at how good the food was! An added bonus was the chocolate they gave us. Crew was professional and courteous." Pros: "The staff upgraded me to business. It was a great wxperience" Pros: "There were good entertainment options though I didn’t use them" Cons: "Our flight was delayed 2.5 hours, during which we had boarded but were told we could not leave our seats even for the bathroom. We were offered a cup of water once during this delay which is inexcusable. (We were also woken up to serve dinner at 1am so that was incredibly inconvenient for an overnight flight) On top of that, I, as well as many others missed our connecting flight. Personally I missed my connection by 20 minutes, which seems a reasonable amount of time to hold a connecting flight with so many people from our flight on that next one. In missing by only 20 minutes, we have lost an entire day of our trip and are spending 9! hours in the airport today. There was no communication between flights clearly. Despite there being an earlier flight we could’ve been placed on after missing our connection - we did not get booked on this flight. I asked why and they just randomly placed people on random flights with no regard for when we showed at the desk. In this scenario, a first come first serve would have alleviated an absolutely awful experience. I will never fly Swiss Air again and will urge people I know to not fly this airline. The experience was extremely frustrating, the best response from an employee was “that’s all I can do for you” and I wish it on no one." Pros: "The planes are clean and relatively comfortable." Cons: "Extremely rigid rules. My flight was the day of the blizzard in Boston, Tues, 3/13. Despite 5 calls to Swiss to reroute me out of Montreal, an airport I could actually get to, they would not relent. I finally just drove there and a really nice agent changed my flight since Logan was closed and all public transport was shut down. Even if my scheduled flight from boston wasn't canceled (I have no idea) they were incredibly unhelpful about the fact that I physically could not get to logan in time for my flight. (Mass DOT was asking everyone to stay off ALL roads). THEN on the way home, they would NOT let me fly back to Montreal where my car was!! WAY TOO RIGID RULES. Screw the customer!" accomodating check in staff, friendly flight crew ( a crew member was speaking tactlessly and was overfamiliar with passengers Very good airline. There is still some room for improvement but overall I’m happy Pros: "Crew are always top notch, free drinks are readily available and entertainment system is great." Cons: "The food portions and quality have definitely declined over the years sadly, as carriers cut costs no doubt." Pros: "The crew was so kind and amazing. They definitely made our flight great!" Cons: "The entertainment wasn’t working for most of the flight. We only got about an hour and a half of entertainment" Pros: "Great crew, good in-flight movies. Good food." Cons: "Wifi connectivity was poor for most of the flight. Plane was very hot it was difficult to sleep." Pros: "Amazing crew, excellent drinks and decent food. Very comfortable seat" Cons: "Everything was great" Pros: "Crew was great !!!" Cons: "Seating in upper class is uncomfortable and bedding is not fresh." Pros: "Premium economy was perfect, smaller cabin with less people, great flight." Pros: "Everything! From check-in all the way to the landing of the plane I was really satisfied! There were a couple crew members that really made the flight feel so at-home/friendly that one could not help but just smile and relax in the flight. Awesome job crew on Flight VA69!" Cons: "I wish my partner and his family were with my parents and I on the flight to enjoy the experience we had as well." Pros: "Crew was great. Flight was on time and crew helped the boarding process go smoothly. It was nice to get a beer or wine at no additional cost." Cons: "Seat was shockingly small, even for economy class. TV was poor quality." Flight was cancelled after 3 1/2 hours. Support for rebooking was overwhelmed. Lost first class tickets and to fly economy. Pros: "The crew was great. The pilots too." Cons: "The audio and video at my seat did not work correctly." Cons: "Nothing, really. Airlines unfortunately can’t make people patient or polite, & I can’t afford a private jet, so I’ll have to settle for an eye roll or twelve." Cons: "During this trip all my flights got delayed and I was told that I could not get a hotel room and had to pay for myself." Cons: "Plane was late taking off. Crew did not provide water when requested. They were busy with beverages that they could sell at a cost." Pros: "The crew was very friendly. The plane was very quiet (except for noisy crying babies)." Cons: "Unless you can afford the higher priced "comfort class" or first class seats, the seating is very, very cramped on Delta's 757s. It's a good thing the flight was only 5+ hours (but that's not long enough to get any decent amount of sleep on this flight scheduled as a redeye)." Pros: "The only thing I liked about the experience and flight was the Delta Sky Club" Cons: "Everything" Pros: "Seat was hard, not much foot space" Cons: "My wife and Iasked for a snack, it was never delivered" Pros: "Seating was fine" Cons: "Did not have a wheelchair waiting for my wife when we arrived in LAX" Pros: "Crew was friendly" Cons: "An hour and a half late, terrible communication about scheduling" Pros: "Check in was very smooth. Flight crew was very attentive" Cons: "Presentation of food was not great." Pros: "Flight delayed due to tech issue but they still boarded us and held on plane no water no bathroom no cell phone signal for 5 hours" Cons: "The accommodation of passengers in the event of a flight cancellation" Cons: "Avianca flight from Bogota to Guayaquil was l4 hours ate in arriving and connecting fight from Guayaquil to San Cristobal, already over an hour late in leaving Guayaquil would not Waite an extra 20 minutes for us. Only 1 flight a day from Guayaquil to San Cristobal so we are faced with a an overnigh" Pros: "Enjoy the direct flight. Entertainment options are great. Crew is courteous and helpful." Cons: "Seat is not comfortable at all, especially for short stature like me. Tough for a six hour, overnight flight." Pros: "Flight conexión departed on time" Cons: "Did not have any help for conecting flight despite late departure from Lima" Pros: "What I like most was the young man that checked in my suit cases. He was beyond amazing: personable, professional, understanding, and overall amazing!" Cons: "The plane from Boston to Bogota was a bit late, but not by much." Pros: "Good entertainment and food." Cons: "The flight was quite delayed, and also had to wait a while once landed. Not much leg space." Cons: "Entertainment only in Spanish is very poor for a long haul flight, as there were many English on board to Heathrow. When questioning this we were simply told it was technical, nothing could be done." Cons: "I was told hours before my flight that my flight was delayed due to weather in the NYC area and that the new flight time was two hours later. There were no weather issues at this time. This delay made me miss my connection and the only option was for me to have a 24 hour layover in Bogota, Colombia. As a woman traveling alone this was not acceptable to me but I had no other choice. I got a hotel room for the evening and tried to make the best of it. I was not offered any compensation for this inconvenience, nothing, not even an offer to pay for my hotel room. Similar things happened to three other people in my group that I was meeting in Peru all traveling from different locations. I lost an entire day in Peru because of this. On my return flight Avianca changed the times as well and I was forced to take an earlier fight home the day before I was scheduled to leave. I therefore lost a total of two days of my vacation because of Avianca and they did NOTHING to compensate me for it. STAY AWAY FROM THIS AIRLINE!!!" Pros: "I arrived to my destination safely." Cons: "Sound didn’t work for the sreen in headrests on my whole row. Asked if they could reset, kept being told they would, but never did. Seats are extremely uncomfortable. Butt and back hurt. No good air circulation, especially if you sit by the window. The middle seat feels it more. Lack of caring from crew unless you spoke Spanish."
