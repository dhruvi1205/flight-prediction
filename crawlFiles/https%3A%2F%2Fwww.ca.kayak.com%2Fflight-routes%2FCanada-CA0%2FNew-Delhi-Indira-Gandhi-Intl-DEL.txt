Excellent crew, excellent food, excellent aircraft, and excellent leg room. No recommendations." Pros: "The crew was great and entering and exiting the plane was quick." Cons: "The seats could have been more comfortable, but I feel like that is a comment for most planes that fly internationally." Cons: "Very good airline except for the fact that the staff at Narita airport." Pros: "All of the crews were polite and friendly, and the food was tasty." Cons: "If there're more variety of movies, that would be great."

Pros: "Beautifully presented and tasty Japanese food. Electronic windows." Cons: "Not overly impressed with the 12:05am departure time. Western food not overly impressive. Having to travel from the plane to terminal by bus." Pros: "New plane, excellent service both on the ground and air. Above average food." Pros: "I was randomly upgraded for the first 10 hours of my trip to Premium economy and it was amazing. Two big hot meals served throughout the flight and plenty of drink service. lots of leg room and could recline comfortably. Flight attendants were wonderful and very helpful. Lots of new movies to watch and games to keep you entertained." Cons: "Flew economy for the 2nd part of my trip and the seat was very hard and was impossible to get comfy. Same meal service as premium economy and was once again delicious. Much colder on this flight and the thin blankets do very little to help." Boarding was delayed but the information about delays was not provided On both legs of my trips (Jhb - Dxb and Dxb - Jhb) the entertainment system did not work. Overall experience was bad , one does not expect after travelling for 14 hrs in Boing 777-300 ER to be pushed in to a craft with a extermly poor seating pitch, no room for hand baggage in the luggege bins and extermly poor service quality. This patch made my overall expereince mediocre and would definetly look for better choices when flying in or out of Delhi in future. Crew was not good and service was bad. Not happy 1. Please deploy better trained and courteous staff. 2. Wheel chairs be available at all steps of layover till boarding gate. 3. Food services be also improved . 4. TV and phone charging facility be also provided. Cabin crew were not welcoming.was expecting excellent after traveling in Emirates from Houston to Dubai.

Cons: "The boarding crew at the gate did not say anything while weighing the carry on bag. I was ask to go to another person who issued me check in baggage sticker and told me to hand over your baggage to a person inside. At last he mentioned to not put any valuables in that bag. My carry on bag was just 1lb extra and the first person could have told me right away and I would have thrown away chocolates and brought down the weight to permissible limit. In general passenger do carry valuable stuff in carry on bag. I had to follow whatever I was told." Pros: "The entertainment was great and the crew was very friendly and helpful" Cons: "The ability to access bathrooms after turbulence has ended" My Tv don’t work the whole from Doha to New Delhi. Overnight didn’t work from Bos to Doha and had to eat food without light Good and comfortable flight Helpful crew Decent food and drinks Was humiliated at Doha airport, treaded like a cattle class traveler, I hold platinum pro status with AA and I don’t fly economy even domestic but was made to travel in the middle seat in economy class and boarding zone 3 and was denied lounge access at Doha airport. Never was humiliated like this before. Nothing I knew what I was getting into ; no complaints when on string budget Privacy and comfort of the QSuites is wonderful. The boarding process in Doha is cumbersome and confusing. As transfer passengers, traveling in Business Class, we went through security twice, including one at the gate requiring all electronic devices removed from bags and watches off, which are a great way to lose belongings as a few hundred people rush through to board the plane.

When we arrived, we were required to upgrade (90,000 yen total) in order to be seated together. We made the reservation 2 months earlier. Seems like it would have been possible to put us together." Pros: "Check in staff were good. We departed on time." Cons: "Better if they could provide maybe nuts I flight but if not, it's still all good for an hour flight.." Pros: "Crew members were as friendly and helpful as always" Cons: "Being disabled doesn't always mean that you get on and as quickly as you would like. We were the first off in SeaTac, but the last to be taken to Passport control." Pros: "I liked that I was able to get back home." Cons: "Everything. There was no organization when boarding, the crew denied me food when I woke up from my nap. Not foreigner friendly at all. The crew was not attentive and I needed to keep calling them for service. Not mindful that this is a long trip." Pros: "Asiana crew was very cooperative and helping. The were fast and always bringing water and juice to passengers in 9.5 hrs flight. they were thorough in takeoff and landing preparedness." Cons: "one check-in crew (female) at gate was not very nice. My mom is disabled & in her personal wheelchair. The other check-in crew members told us (5 total) to go together to board the plane then this female staff told us we can only have one family member go in with my mom (to take care of the wheelchair then assist her on the plane) next time we board the plane. Their messages are inconsistent & her attitude was uncalled for, especially when she let other disabled passengers on with their more than one family members & the other Asiana staff members told us to go in at the same time." Pros: "Great entertainment system for every seats unlike the other 777 I took a few days ago. This one also had plug-ins available. As always, cabin attendants were excellent." Cons: "Food quality was not as good as my earlier Asiana flight from Honolulu to Seoul." Pros: "The food was great and the crew was very helpful. For my first international flight things couldn't have went smoother" Cons: "I had a middle seat would have looked the window and a little more leg room. But I am taller then average." Pros: "The food is so good." Cons: "The check in counter is not fully organized. I encounter so much delay in checking in my luggage. The new employee must be properly assisted by the old personnel to avoid long hours of waiting and standing in the counter of the passengers who arrived early so they can check in their baggage ahead of time. I availed of your web check in but was waiting for so long in the check in counter." Pros: "The seat layout" Cons: "The seat belt very short on one side hard to operate" We were very impressed with Swiss Air. The service was exceptional. Unfortunately, we had a baby behind us that screamed for hours. , It was a nightmare, though I completely understand that it was not Swiss Airs fault. Pros: "The crew was super friendly and attentive. Best in flight service I have received in a long time." Cons: "The plane doesn't have usb ports to charge the phones, and as there are no screens or anything else, make sure you bring your battery pack." Pros: "Flight was cancelled. Kayak did not notify us. We found out by accident. There was no customer service from kayak. We had to solve with with the airline" Pros: "flight itself" Cons: "delayed departure EXTREMELY LATE LUGGAGE HANDLING IN BRUSSELS, more than 1 hour after arrival for SKI's to be delivered !!" Pros: "Crew were very nice and accommodating. Chocolate always appreciated!" Cons: "The passenger in front of me slammed into my knees. I am very tall. She was not but she sure got her seat back as far as possible in spite of having he bulkhead sear, so I had to be careful of my position the rest of the flight" Cons: "Seat could have been more comfortable but the leg room was good" Cons: "The plane waited 40 minutes for delayed connecting flights to arrive. It's great for some passengers because they don't miss the transatlantic flight, but it causes others to miss their connections on the other end. It added to very stressful deplaning." Pros: "All great!" Cons: "if my luggage would of arrived with me, Swiss airlines left behind 2 of 4 pieces of luggage in Zurich! I hope I can get them back!" Pros: "Food was ok" Cons: "AC was not turned on until flight was up in air. That means for 30 minutes passengers were sweating sitting in a suffocating cabin. Crew refused to give Green Tea, saying only available in business class Inflight screen size was very small ...5-6 inches only" Cons: "Swiss Air from Athens to Zurich stellar—excellent service, seating, food—but left one hour late due to air traffic. Nearly missed connecting Edelweiss flight—and that flight was just terrible. Passengers behind me constantly kicking, pulling my seat—wouldn’t allow me to put seat in recline position."
