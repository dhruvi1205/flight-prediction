I don’t mind paying but some nicer, healthier choices would have been nice. It is airplane food so no real surprise. :)" Pros: "Crew were fairly attentive, have experienced better. Liked the Canadian entertainment options, even if very limited." Cons: "Seats were okay, the plane is really showing it's age. Movie selection was very limited, and very dated." Cons: "Wake people up when serving anything.. I have seen in some other airlines that one is provided with a sticker to place on your seat to show if you can or cannot be woken up" Cons: "The baggage restriction was not good at least one Checking should be allowed" Cons: "Minor point. They boarded the plane very early. We got to the gate 1/2 hour before departure, and were almost the last ones to board." Cons: "My other WestJet flights let me have access to wifi via the WestJet app and the entertainment console. I was disappointed to not have access on this flight." Pros: "Dry accommodating staff all around. Thank you" Cons: "More space between people. Not much you can do I understand that. So overall great" Pros: "We arrived where we wanted to go" Cons: "Separated my son and I into middle seats. Made us sit on the tarmac for 30 minutes due a completely predictable issue. We should have been allowed to stay at the gate. Seating is horribly cramped. Less that friendly flight attendants. Arrived late on a red eye in perfect weather. Otherwise delightfu" Pros: "They were very helpful and polite." Cons: "Times have changed and they offer very little such as entertainment food options. but it was short trip and people need to adjust." Pros: "The crew was very nice" Cons: "Seats are uncomfortable and there’s no tv for entertainment." Pros: "Efficient check in. Liked the shuttle bus service from subway to airport." Cons: "As expected this is a commuter flight so very stripped down in terms of amenities. Tight plane seating and those overhead bins just barely accommodate the carry on." Cons: "Needs to be more clear that you have to pay to bring bag on." Cons: "The crew could have checked us in...we were 5 minutes late for checkin and had to book and pay for another flight." Cons: "After boarding had to deplane and go on another aircraft." Pros: "Very convenient, non stops and airport is close to downtown" Cons: "Captain said the 1 hour delay was due to bad weather in Washington DC but there was no bad weather in DC. He should have said the truth. I was in flight 729 from Toronto to Washington Dulles airport on 7/7." Cons: "Like mentioned previously, long delays, followed by a snafu in the boarding process forcing a manual check in of all passengers. net outcome: 1.5h delay. First experience counts, in my case it was a mediocre one." Pros: "Crew were lovely" Cons: "2 short hauls. Somewhat turbulent. No one can fix that,crept the Big Guy" Pros: "The snacks were great and crew was friendly!" Cons: "My seat was covered in crumbs, cleanliness overall could have been better." Cons: "Buyer beware! When you buy this basic package, they charge $37 for your first bag and another $50 for your carry-on. I just paid $97 for one piece of luggage and a carry-on! This practically doubles the cost of the ticket. Not only false advertising, but highway robbery!" Cons: "Was.not pleased I had to pay $44 to check my carry on!" Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "The city I went to was locked down due to covid. Neither the airline nor budget air helped me get a refund before the flight took off.. Still waiting to hear back..." Cons: "There was a delay of 4 hours to board from Montreal to Paris. with not any justification or valuable reason from the crew." Pros: "The crew on the actual flight was excellent." Cons: "The staff at the Toronto airport was rude The baggage policy was unclear and they had trouble answering our questions. We could have saved a good amount of money if the baggage policy was more clear and the staff could explain it. Using the term "Economy" for all flight categories is not helpful." Pros: "We were upgraded to premium economy for free at check-in. The crew was very kind" Cons: "We did not enjoy the entertaining system as the headphones were not complementary. The food was quite okay but quantity was sparce and no cheese provided. Also service was slow. Drinks were served 10 minutes after meal ☹️" Pros: "Crew is nice." Cons: "Had to wait 15 mins because our gate was in use. Seats are old and hard." Cons: "Travelled from Toronto,CA to Lyon, FR and wasn't pleased with service, food, no coffee available plus drinks were limited. And on top of that when I arrived in Lyon, my baggage wasn't delivered from Toronto (was told at baggage claim desk). I paid $70 dollars for something that didn't get delivered." Pros: "Old plane so seat pitch was good" Cons: "Maintenance issues meant a 2 hour delay where we stayed on the plane" Pros: "The crew was amazing. They were super friendly and attentive. Amazing service!" Pros: "Clean modern plane. Nice crew." Cons: "Seats were far too narrow. Couldn't sit back without overlapping shoulders." Cons: "No entertainment, staff rude... i do not recommend flying with air transat to Puerto Rico" On time departure with early arrivals. My last flight arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule which was great due to my long commute home 3+ hours. The cabin crews on all 3 flights were great. See ya in 7 days Air Canada The flight was delayed boarding. Then we sat on the tarmac waiting to be pushed back. We were over 2 hours late arriving in Montreal. We had about 15 minutes to make our connecting flight to our destination of Quebec and as we exited the plane, we were told to hurry that they were holding the plane for about 15-20 of us. Well, I put my wife in a wheelchair and trotted to the next gate only to be told “sorry, the plane just left.” All 3 of our flights were on Air Canada and they were responsible. We eventually got a flight 8 hours later and arrived in Quebec at MIDNIGHT instead of 2 PM in the afternoon. Earlier flights were full and we almost had to wait until the next day. These were the flights we had to take to get to our cruise ship leaving Quebec the next day. Air Canada was at fault for all this mess. Aircraft was delayed in its arrival for the flight and was delayed from Halifax to Montreal. Flight from Toronto was cancelled. Put me on next flight an hour later. That flight was delayed, putting me in jeopardy of missing my connecting flight to Morocco in Montreal. They pulled me out of line and got me onto another flight to Montreal. We arrived in Montreal. It then had to wait 20 min on the tarmac because the gate wasn’t ready for us. Ran to catch the Morocco flight. Made it as they were boarding, only having to wait 90 minutes for further delays in leaving Montreal (baggage issues, “technical” issues). Arrived in Morocco over an hour late and almost missed my first meeting in Tanger. This trip had to be rebooked already from the end of August because the flight from Toronto to Montreal was also cancelled back then, forcing me to miss my flight to Morocco. Actually I’ll complain because there was not even a coffee served. In a 6 hour stay in the aircraft, not one meal not one decent service. It’s a shame. Instead I was charged an extra fee for baggage(just by aircanada) The second part of my route was done by Swiss, which offered 2 good quality meals, regular beverage supply for almost equal flight time. Our Air Canada flight 8569 from Montreal to Atlanta on August 26, 7:30 pm, was cancelled due to mechanical problems. AC customer service rep at the Montreal airport wanted to put us on two more AC flights, Montreal to Toronto, then Toronto to ATL, for the following day. We asked for the 7 am next morning non-stop Delta flight from Montreal to ATL, and got it. Air Canada put us up in a hotel in Montreal for the evening. Next time, we'll spend the extra $$ to take Delta. Flight canceled. Extremely difficult to communicate with Air Canada about options. Not sure why our chosen seats got changed without notice and my husband and I were assigned seats ten rows and the whole width of the plane apart. But we were able to get this changed thanks to two helpful gate agents in Toronto and Montreal. Air Canada books those flights absolutely solid and cancels a lot of flights. Our connecting flight was delayed and missed so we spent another night in Montreal at our own expense. We were then given tickets with an extra stop in Toronto, so my luggage never made it to Detroit. They have no office in Detroit, so her I am a week out with no luggage and no one answers the phone at Air Canada. Now I know why everyone has so much carry on. Delayed flight, then we got stuck in the queue to the runway, which could be prevented if flight was not delayed. Flight delayed by 4 hours but no communication. With passengers until after the posted departure time became apparent the flight was not going to board even close to on time. Flight was sent canceled. The absolute most useless staff I have ever witnessed. Utterly careless - literally could not care less. 100% never using this airline again. Poor communication at the check in counter and boarding gates. Other then the screaming baby the flight was fine, nothing special Check in experience was smooth, and the flight attendants were courteous and friendly. Very positive experience overall, thank you all! Flight arrived late but other than that everything else okay Great price for a new plane. Only offered water which we knew.
