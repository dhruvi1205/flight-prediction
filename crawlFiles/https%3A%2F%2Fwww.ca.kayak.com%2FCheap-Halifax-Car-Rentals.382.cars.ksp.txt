KAYAK’s top tips for renting a car in Halifax Halifax is the major economic and cultural hub of Nova Scotia and Atlantic Canada. A rental car is the best transport choice as it will provide the scope to enjoy the breathtaking rugged coastline and reach major tourist attractions such as Peggy’s Cove with ease. Halifax has extensive maritime cultural history, which cannot be truly understood without traveling along the jagged coastline roads and stopping by small rural towns such as Duncan’s Cove and Clam Harbour. Halifax Stanfield International Airport is located 35 km (22 miles) from the downtown district and, thanks to the quiet and uncongested roads, will take approximately 40 minutes to reach by car. Major car rental companies such as Alamo, Avis, Hertz, Thrifty, and Budget have counters at Halifax Stanfield International Airport and are located on the lower level of the airport parking area. Once you have picked up your baggage, follow the signage displayed Airport Parkade and you will have the keys in your hand before you know it. Despite being a major industrial hub for Atlantic Canada, Halifax holds on to its small-town culture -- and this is represented on the roads. Pedestrians are always given priority and often cross at random sections of the street. Therefore, keep a careful eye out for pedestrians and cyclists, especially in built-up residential areas or in the downtown district. Driving around Halifax is a peaceful experience; road congestion is a rarity and commuters are known to travel at appropriate speeds and yield. If you plan on traveling west towards the rural community of Peggy’s Cove, take the scenic northern route (103 Highway, then Peggy’s Cove Road) and enjoy the wonderful scenery and lighthouses along the way. 25% of our users found rental cars in Halifax for C$ 59 or less Book your rental car in Halifax at least 1 day before your trip in order to get a below-average price Off-airport rental car locations in Halifax are around 34% cheaper than airport locations on average Intermediate rental cars in Halifax are around 62% cheaper than other car types, on average Halifax car rental experiences: the best tips from KAYAK users Insights shared by verified travelers who rented a car in Halifax Learn how KAYAK collects reviews and tips from users.

MLJul. 2023 Make sure you are in time for pickup the vehicle and call ahead if you are not !!! Also make sure your fuel gage shows that the tank is 100% full even the gas pump nozzle is shutting the distributor off …. Be patient with filling the gas if not you need to pay big premium at the rental office… Otherwise Halifax is the great place to rent a car !!! Verified travelerAug. 2023 Halifax is a beautiful area. It is best to stay away from the harbour with a rental so parking and walking may be a preferred mode of transportation. Shopping options are great at the local malls and stores. We also enjoyed exploring the province and bravely ventured to PEI across the Confederation Bridge. Road signs were effective at guiding this longer excursion.

Drop off but I must have made a mistake as it showed 10am so I asked if it could be extended up to 4pm and was told sure, no problem but was not told by the manager and owner I would be charged an additional day or $75. Which was on top of the 75 I already paid for dropping it off at the airport. If I was told I could have just dropped it off at the pickup place on time and saved $150. and simply taken a cab to the airport. Also I was offered which I needed a car with g.p.S. But it was a very large car that I did not feel comfortable with as I am 81 yrs old and the smaller car which is all they had was not what I had requested and did not have g.p.s.. the next day I came back for a car with gps but they did not have one,they said so gave me a Garmen but charged me $100. and really it did not work that well. So you asked for my thoughts and this is how I feel. The girl I rented from was excellent. Just be honest and up front!! 10.0 Wonderful Sep. 2023Service was fast & easy, car was ready to go.

Cons:Car interior was worst I ever had. Ketchup on steering wheel, dirty seats and console. Dead bugs. Also hidden charge discovered when dropping off. Agent at time fixed it so that ended up ok. 5.6 Fair Aug. 2018 Cons:The interior of the car was not detailed, it had not been cleaned. There was mud smeared on the bottom passenger door panel, potato chips on the floor and under the drivers seat. There was an old receipt from the dollar store, the dash was very dusty and hadn't been cleaned, the media screen had fingerprints all over it and the drivers door panel had dirt smudged on it. I had to clean the car myself for my passengers. Not what I expected from Enterprise. 4.8 Mediocre Jul. 2018 Cons:Had to come back on second day to sort out my messed up invoice which lost a whole morning of my vacation while trying to get the correct invoice as advertised when I booked the car on line. If I had not gone back I would have been charged for another $200 extra than advertised plus the vehicle did not have a full tank and I had to make sure that was indicated correctly. In the end the supervisor had to come out and sort out the incorrect invoice and seemed to be the only person who knew what to do.

The manager at the Avis outlet in Halifax was courteous and helpful. Though I rented with Kayak, he found my Avid Preferred number in the system and saved me a little more. We immediately drove up to Cape Breton and all over the island. Very enjoyable trip, and the car served its purpose quite well. If we visit NS again, I will certainly rent with this agency. Cons:Not the franchise's fault, but the road construction on Grafton Street in Halifax, not to mention all over downtown was horrible. This is on the City, with a seeming lack of proper traffic flow analysis before they'd shut down streets. Total lack of signage too. 9.2 Wonderful Jul. 2017 Pros:Friendly representatives, clean car, modern Cons:Gas tank wasn't completely filled at pickup, didn't notice till started driving 10.0 Wonderful Oct. 2016 Pros:The car was clean and in good condition; the counter help at pick up in Halifax was very friendly and very informative; the drop off at the airport was quick and easy. 8.8 Very good Sep. 2016 Pros:They were conveniently located in the city center. The agent was by himself when we arrived soon after they opened, but he was very helpful. Perhaps we were scheduled to drop off at the airport location, we were super-upgraded for free. Cons:Nothing really. If we must, the upgrade was a bit too luxurious (we'd requested an economy car, as it was just two of us with not much luggage, but got a Cherokee. Hmm, extra gas...)

The customer in front of me asked EVERY question imaginable and some that were unimaginable and then of course the attendant was trying to up sell.

Once they got done our transaction went smoothly and we were on our way. 8.0 Very good Dec. 2019 Pros:Helpful staff, efficient, quick pick up and drop off. 6.8 Okay Aug. 2019 Pros:Drop off was off hours. The signage for Hertz was poor. Only Avis and budget were marked prominently on the lot. Signage and instructions could be more obvious. Cons:Thrifty pickup was poor as no cars were available. They had to shuttle me to the local Hertz instead to complete the contract. It took about 1.5hrs to get my vehicle. Once gotten, it was fine as it looks like they gave me an upgraded car-by choice or not, I don’t know.

Not horrible, but not washed, and had dirty floor mats and a couple of scattered pieces of debris inside. This was not a terrible experience, but the pickup-dropoff wait of more than half an hour made it not worth it. I went by the counter of the competition in the bus station, and they had a much shorter line.

Cons:I didn't like how my rate went from $89 to $177 because I asked to extend it less than 24 hours longer which in the beginning they told me was okay to do. The lady who I spoke with on the phone was extremely rude, so I asked to speak with a manager who was much better to deal with. I think the charges associated with extending it a day was excessive and I felt ripped off. I wouldn't recommend this company.

It should have been mentioned on our rental agreement. 2) We were contacted by Alamo the next day that there was damage to the vehicle. It was marked on our form when we picked up the vehicle but it was not communicated on the receiving end. My husband informed them of this and it was cleared.

No issues. 9.2 Wonderful Aug. 2017 Pros:New car, clean and comfortable. Cons:Line up to pick up was 15 minutes. Price. 10.0 Wonderful Aug. 2017 Pros:The cost of the car wasn't as cheap as I'd hoped, but it was cheaper than any other site I looked at without discount. The car was very clean and was great on gas. There were no additional fees after returning the car, and the staff was friendly. I had no problems with this rental Cons:The distance of the hertz rental place from the airport meant that I had to pay for a $70 cab ride, but it was still cheaper than renting from the airport. 10.0 Wonderful May 2017 Pros:Option to upgrade for free. Friendly and interested staff. 4.0 Mediocre Aug. 2023I had requested a sedan. Upon arrival, I was advised the only option was a jeep. This was very disappointing. I regularly drive an SUV but the jeep was large and boxy. I was on edge driving the vehicle throughout my rental period. While I do recognize rental vehicles are in short supply due to a shortage of cars and high demand, I continue to be frustrated that my 'only option' was presented as a jeep while others before and after me were provided with easier to drive options. I was relieved to drop the jeep off at the airport. I considered returning it after day 1 but the flexibility and understanding shown by Hertz staff was cold and verged on inconsiderate. When I am spending over $900 to rent a car for 5 days, my expectations are high. With my daughter in University at Dalhousie, we will return to the area. I will be very hesitant to rely on Hertz in the future or mentally prepare myself for substandard customer service.

Had a Hyundai Sonata, very nice car with good fuel economy. Cons:We arrived at Halifax airport late (9:30 PM), and called the number. No answer. Waited about 10 minutes, called again, go someone to pick us up. Staff should have headsets to be able to answer phone wherever they are, to avoid panic attacks by customers. 7.6 Good Jun. 2017 Pros:Car was good fitted with satnav fitted and we received an upgrade Cons:Rental company would not accept vehicle excess insurance which had been purchased, so we had to take full insurance with the rental company which was more expensive and then claim a refund on the external policy Back 1 out of 2 Next National 10.0 Wonderful No reviews available Cleanliness 10.0 Comfort 10.0 Pick-up/Drop-off 10.0 Value for money 10.0 One location in HalifaxShow locations from C$ 96/day View deals Car rental locations Locations in Halifax 1161 Hollis Street +1 902 423 0227 Monday 08:00 -
