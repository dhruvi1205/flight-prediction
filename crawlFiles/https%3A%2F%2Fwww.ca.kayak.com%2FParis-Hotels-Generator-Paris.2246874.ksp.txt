I stayed there with my 17 year old niece and her friend and wanted them to be somewhere fun and full of interesting international people that start in their age range. The food was good and the dining area was a great common area for hanging out. Cons:I wish towels were included in the room and didn’t have to be rented. There should also be soap available even if it’s to purchase. Maybe a vending machine with some toiletries in it? A 7.4 Good Anonymous, Oct. 2016 Pros:The design and cleanliness are superb. Cons:Location is not great. 30 minutes metro, or 18 euro taxi minimum from anywhere i wanted to be. Had problems with inhospitable and rude staff. Roof is closed for the 'season' for renovations, and i booked this hotel for the roof.
