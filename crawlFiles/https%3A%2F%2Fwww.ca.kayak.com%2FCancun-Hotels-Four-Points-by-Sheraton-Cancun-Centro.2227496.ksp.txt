Every part of the hotel that I saw was very clean. The room was spacious and the bathroom was well portioned. I especially like the feature that the room key activated the room lights and once removed would stay on for only 5 mins. Check in and check out was a breeze and it was practically a straight line to the airport. Easy location to get to and from. Muchos gracias! L 10.0 Wonderful LeRoy, Mar. 2015 Pros:We booked last minute and still got a good rate; the place was very comfortable and the staff was kind. They have a restaurant and bar that is very good. The wait staff was attentive and they had a great live band.
