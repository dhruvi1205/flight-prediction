Cons: "Canceling flights with no notice and rescheduling made me lose a day" Cons: "Especially for USA and Canada travel, allow some luggage, you guys embarrassed my child by charging her luggage fee because she had to bring a device she requires. She felt embarrassed." Pros: "The crew is really good. Super nice and attentive." Cons: "Honestly, while the flight delay was a hassle. Probably nothing because flight delays happen. My bag was placed on the next flight. But your crew’s attitude made it all better." Cons: "Flight was delayed. It happens, I know. First time using this airline, ended up landing 1.5 hour later than planned. The boarding process in Toronto was bizantyne, with some discrepancy in the checks and balance forcing a manual check in of all passengers. Amateurish." Pros: "Crew was very attentive and pleasant." Cons: "Stop charging for carry on baggage for outside of Canada flights." Pros: "The crew was very nice, and I love the complimentary craft beer!" Cons: "The agent spents too much time attempting to rearrange the line up rather than help guests check-in, causing a backlog. When issues were brought to them, they seemed disinterested in solving the problem - water was spilled in line and when brought to the agents attention she seemed annoyed." Cons: "Plane had to return due to bad weather at destination. 90 minute delay." Pros: "Hassle free" Cons: "Since it's a small bombardier the leg space is pretty restricted.. only adjustable for short flights" Cons: "Started off by being 40 mins delayed. Not bad, compared to the 4 hour delay I had going to Vancouver. Flight was super uncomfortable. Upon arrival to Toronto. The gate had ice on it. So we had to wait in the plane for over an hour before we could get to a gate and off the plane. And then the entire plane of people (300-400 people I believe?) had to wait for our bags to come out for TWO HOURS! Meanwhile flights from Vancouver that we’re supposed to leave after us , left before us, got there before us, and got their bags before us. Horrible trip. I could not believe how unprofessional and unprepared Air Canada and the Toronto airport was during the holidays!" Pros: "Air Canada has one of the best buy on board menu's of any North American carrier. They even allow you to purchase Business Class meals (subject to availability of course). Flying on the older 767-300ER also has more shoulder and leg room than some of Air Canada's newer configurations for the 787 and 777." Cons: "Air Canada's boarding process is a bit frustrating. On American Airlines and United Flight attendants make announcements over the PA to (a) step out of the aisle to let people pass, and (b) place larger suitcases in the overhead and smaller bags under the seat. That way they try to ensure there is enough bin space to accommodate everyone. Passengers on Air Canada stuff everything in to the overhead bin and nothing under their seat, leaving little for those boarding after and delaying the flight because flight attendants are looking for bin space. If they were more pro-active, it would speed things up." Pros: "Your customers are nicer than your staff." Cons: "Firstly I will start with the lack of service we provided when trying to get seats together after checking in online. We rang and were told to try at the airport counter. Then at the airport counter we were told to try at the gate and then at the gate when I went to ask I was told to go get both tickets before they told us that there was no 2 seats together anyway rather than looking first. All whilst explaining this was our honeymoon and we would really like to sit together as husband and wife. Then once we boarded the guy sitting next to me was happy to swap seats with my wife as he had back problems and had asked for an aisle seat but was denied. Finally we are underway and I find that my entertainment touch screen doesn't work so even though it is one i can't select anything to watch. Plus to top it off the seat arm rest was broken. Obviously with a fairly full flight with no 2 seats together their wasn't much that could be done immediately but where is the maintenance and actual physical plane quality? Do your engineers or staff not check things? Overall dispite this being our national carrier I am ashamed to claim that. Many of our overseas visitors for the wedding from Australia and Europe also had similar complaints." Pros: "Quick boarding, staff friendly and helpful. Flight attendants ensured those with connecting flights deplaned quickly when we arrived at the gate in Montreal." Pros: "I liked the fact that they provided beverages and food." Cons: "I hated how there was NO entertainment. Honestly on a 12 + hour flight this was a bit ridiculous. No tv, or movies... no screen on the seat at all. Not even a big one for everyone to enjoy! It was horrible... The seats were so cramped and the staff seemed a bit unprofessional and sloppy looking. The food was pretty bad as well. I've had my fair share amount of flights and honestly this was probably the worse one i've gone on with the amount of hours it took to get to our destination. I wouldn't have mind too much if there was no entertainment on a 2 or 3 hour flight..." Cons: "My seat assignment was changed without my knowledge. There was a charge for my one suitcase. Most other airlines do not charge for a suitcase unless it is more then one." Pros: "I flew through Vancouver from Boston on my way to Brisbane, Australia and back. I was nervous at first because of the 2 hour connection windows. This might be a testament to Vancouver Airport more than Air Canada, but the flight home after an initial 14 hour flight was pain free. Boarding was fast (the flight wasn't full) and we ended up pulling away from the terminal early. I slept most of the flight so I can't really comment on food. The entertainment was the same as when i left for Australia, which was ok. It had a decent variety to select from." Pros: "The crew was nice." Cons: "Boarding was unorganized, one of the ladies was rude and I did not get window, even though I requested with enough time." Cons: "dirt and stuff on floor between floor and wall, bad, never seen that before in a nearly new plane" Pros: "Air Canada you suck. Told us that our flight wouldn't leave before we boarded as the computer system was down country wide. We still stood in like for an hour and hey could have manually checked us in as they did others. We were promised no planes would leave and when we got to the gate our plane was pulling away leaving 10 of us to scramble to find another flight. Customer service argued with me saying no flights were going to Ottawa and my Kayak app told me otherwise. Thanks for making my flight home for a funeral that much more stressful and having my family wait 4 hours risking all of our lives with freezing rain drive home."
