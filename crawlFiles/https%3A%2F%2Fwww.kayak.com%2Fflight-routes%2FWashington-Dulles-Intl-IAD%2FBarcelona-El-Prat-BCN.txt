Cons: "Nada, I slept through this leg and the staff let me be." Cons: "We arrived more than a half hour late, and considering this was about 4 am, this was significant. The guy in the middle seat was tall and had to speard his legs intruding on my space." Pros: "The boarding process was much easier and faster. No delayed flights." Cons: "I used the laboratory before takeoff as I was one of the first people on the plane and I forgot to go before I boarded. The hand soap container was empty and I had to tell one of the crew. Shouldn’t that have been taken care of before boarding passengers?" Pros: "the CREW WAS FRIENDLY AND CELEBRATING EASTER WITH THE GUESTS" Cons: "THE FOOD WAS ADEQUATE, GIVEN THAT WE WERE ON AN AIRPLANE" Cons: "Seats and leg space were uncomfortable, staff could have been friendlier and more presentable (cleaner appearance)" Pros: "Good crew and despite the short flight we even got a sandwich which was great after a long day" Cons: "No entertainment but short flight" Pros: "the crew was great." Cons: "they asked us to check in our carry-on because the plane was full.I had important papers so I had to explain my situation. I hate confrontation so I felt anxious and I'm already an anxious flier. I feel that this should only pertain to people with larger carry-on. my was below the average size." Pros: "787 is an excellent plane and I could sleep a little" Cons: "I was boarding at gate C4. Doesn't anyone get it ! Using the word "bomb" in airports is a big no-no however C4 is OK? Even a little old lady knows what C4 stands for." Pros: "Nice self boarding" Cons: "No big screen to communicate priority to boarding since I am deaf." Pros: "This is the way to fly long haul." Cons: "Frustration is it is impossible to sleep during the breakfast service, but this is a problem for all airlines and Virgin is better than most." Cons: "The service on Virgin Australia is quite poor. They are barely around. The seats are also only mediocre" Pros: "Very friendly crew. We boarded about an hour before so we were ready to go well before time." Cons: "The economy seats are not that comfortable and the screen for entertainment is sometimes difficult to use." Cons: "Overall, I am disappointed in Kayak for listing my round trip flight as KLM, when in actuality, only one short connection of this flight was actually KLM. My itinerary said KLM all over it, but in the fine print it said "operated by Delta." This is dishonest and misleading." Pros: "Crew was great. Flight was on time and crew helped the boarding process go smoothly. It was nice to get a beer or wine at no additional cost." Cons: "Seat was shockingly small, even for economy class. TV was poor quality." Cons: "We were bussed to the plane, there were long dark hairs on my pillow, and they are generous with snacks at close intervals, but the food could be much better. The ideas are cute, but the actual food is pretty basic, which is disappointing for Virgin, who I hold in high regard. Or did." Pros: "The roomie seats, the USB port, and in flight entertainment" Cons: "Child free section" Pros: "- Special meals available for those with dietary restrictions. - Friendly cabin crew." Cons: "- Boarding kept getting delayed without any warning. - Duty free purchase was meant to be collected just before boarding the plane but mine was not there. This was not so much an issue but the man said he would have my bag sent to my seat and I was subsequently approached by a crew member who asked for my receipt. Which he was holding in his hand. I would have thought it would be quite easy to confirm the person without them having the receipt as the their name and seat number is on the receipt but he had to go back and check if it was okay. - Found it hard to sleep on the overnight flight due to uncomfortable seats. Would probably not be an issue in upper class. - No comment on entertainment as did not use it." Pros: "Very short flight (43 minutes) No food, entertainment or beverage service. Staff did not check young children were strapped in prior to take off resulting in a two year old standing on dads lap throughout take off, flight and landing." Cons: "Lack of importance shown to safety of young children." Pros: "Super friendly and helpful crew, food etc was fantastic very enjoyable flight. Thank you" I wouldn't say I liked being forced to check my small roller bag at the gate; too many people had bags and were in a higher boarding group. Pros: "We were traveling international in Twitter after contacting we were told we can carry one checked baggage but then we were not allowed and at gate they didn’t know the procedure and repeatedly We did not get our special meal we had requested" Cons: "We were traveling international in Twitter after contacting we were told we can carry one checked baggage but then we were not allowed and at gate they didn’t know the procedure and repeatedly We did not get our special meal we had requested" Pros: "On time, service was good" Cons: "Food, I can't understand why the main course has such a poor taste and looks like it was eaten before." Pros: "The crew was very attentive and had great personality. They anticipated any needs we had." Pros: "The plane was nice" Cons: "I’m still sitting in Minneapolis so I would have liked to be at my destination. And I had to pay for the overnight accommodations." Pros: "Entertainment was awesome. Although airlines are stingy with snacks, Delta had a good overall selection and very generous." Cons: "Something that cant be changed overnight, however, there should be a little more Aisle space for folks pass through as my shoulder was getting beat up after every passing person and cart." Pros: "Crew was friendly." Cons: "Wish the seat was more comfortable. Landing was jittery and bumpy." Cons: "The bathrooms smelled every time someone opened the door. Febreeze, please!!"

Pros: "The personal at counter very helpful." Cons: "Some information on website is unknown for call center people, like issues dealing with disabled people." Pros: "Way to go AVIANCA, changing the craft for a bigger one was a great idea!!!" Cons: "Rude check in employees, mediocre flight crew terrible food. Only good thing about the flight was the check in counter people at Asunción airport. The rest was so bad, will never flight with Avianca ever again." Pros: "crew was wonderful but we sat on the runway the whole day and then they cancelled the flight" Pros: "Cada ves que viajo en Avianca , estoy viendo y sintiendo un detrimento en la atención así como en la comodidad de los aviones. Viaje de Washington a Bogotá en busines, y la incomodidad de el avión es desesperante. Q pasa AVIANCA? Acaso se va a acabar nuestra empresa colombiana q ha sido el org" Cons: "The arrival to bogota was a caos. We waited 2 hours to get immigration..." Pros: "Boarding was easy- food was ok. Flight on time" Cons: "The temperature during the flight was to hot Flight attendance were not friendly which is unusual for Avianca" Cons: "Check in at Dulles was chaos, even though we had completed online check in and just needed to do our luggage drop. I am pregnant and was carrying a 2 y/o toddler and had no preferential/priority treatment. Though we arrived 2+ hours before our departure, we only just made our flight. Ground crew were unfamiliar with Brazilian laws on entry for citizens with expired passports. Our bags never left DC and we received them over 72 hours later in Sao Paulo, after much confusion. We were not offered any means of compensation for this inconvenience." Cons: "The flight was delayed for more than an hour at Dulles. When we arrived in Bogota, at 9:40 we had time to catch the connecting flight to Montevideo which was scheduled to leave at 10:20pm.... but instead we stayed in the tarmac without moving for over 45 minutes. There were over 30 passengers that were to take that connecting flight, so the airline had plenty of reasons to wait for us. Instead the airline, AVIANCA, chose to leave all of us stranded in Bogota for 24 hours. We will have all type of problems because of this we had hotel reservations as well as car rental reservations that may be lost because we didn't showed up. By the way according to one of the passengers whose husband travelled on the same flight the day before. The same thing happened to him 1 day earlier." Pros: "I loved the in flight entertainment that reminded me of JetBlue." Cons: "everything sucked time bery bad servive starfed on flight nonacolok was sergvedngypu ilt was really disappoinyling includigbymkthrvlounhr aothee airlione" Pros: "Specially food service and also boarding" Cons: "They checked carry on again even you passed from the counter I felt very bad about this" Pros: "Flight time and layover at connecting flight" Cons: "Food needs to improved. In all other flight Indian spice is served as Asian veg flight seat are too tight" Pros: "The food and entertainment were okay." Cons: "The staff was rude. The entertainment consoles didn’t work well." Pros: "This was a normal flight. Nothing out of the norm. good food, and good entertainment selection." Cons: "They are telling me because I booked with Kayak through PriceLine or vice versa they will not give me any hotel for my 14 hours lay over." Pros: "I liked the food and the staff were very friendly" Pros: "The entertainment was excellent!" Cons: "The comfort level for that long of a flight was very poor. Seats are way too close together. There is no knee room from the seats at the front at all. People operating their video monitor is a disturbing fact for the passengers who sits in front of them." Cons: "My flight was delayed, and the wrong gate was initially listed for my connecting flight, causing me to miss my flight. I asked to transfer to the next flight, but the staff there argued with me and refused to do so, saying I must purchase another ticket. I was forced to purchase a visa, go through passport processing, and purchase a new ticket that cost nearly as much as my entire round trip ticket from the US. I then had to pay to stay overnight in a hotel and had to make alternate arrangements to meet my hosts when I finally reached my destination." Pros: "Amazing food. Can't believe how good the desserts were. Entertainment also top notch."
