Missed connecting train since flight was late into Zurich and I had to stay at airport hotel because of it as well as I had to repurchase train ticket Pros: "The crew was friendly and helpful." Cons: "The aircraft looked new. However the seat widths seemed small. Awkward recline as well. The seats were just not comfortable." Pros: "The crew was really great and helpful" Cons: "Only thing that could have been better was ginger ale." Cons: "Entertainment system is dated. Screens froze often, were not very touch sensitive and the sound was pretty bad (on mine, would only provide sound to one ear, so I had to turn up other bc of poor quality and ended up w a headache.) Also, bathrooms were gross; ran out of paper and floors were "soiled"" Pros: "Excellent service from the crew and prices were good." Cons: "The seats seem to have gotten smaller and were rather uncomfortable for a 7 hour flight." Pros: "We flew Business Class. The crew was professional and attentive. The food was definitely a nice cut above." Cons: "Nothing that I can offer. If I needed to make another trip anywhere ANZ flies, they would be my first choice every time." Pros: "I liked that it was a straight flight from SFO -ZRH. On board entertainment was great." Cons: "Seating is way to tight. Service from crew is nothing at all like it used to with Swiss. Nearly a smile from crew ( both legs of flight) mostly just hand motion when serving food. Food was a big disappointment too. It feels like all the good service is reserved only for business and first class !" Pros: "The inflight entertainment was great and helped to pass the time. The food was good for airline food." Cons: "The flight staff was just okay - they could have been friendlier. The seat cushions seemed old - they were comfortable enough for sitting but not comfortable to sleep." Pros: "I loved that every seat had a pillow, blanket and head-phones waiting. The movie selection was great, too.The service was excellent. Love having metal utensils, and not plastic." Cons: "No fault of the airline, but when passengers recline their seat backs all the way, it's very difficult for the person behind. Two vegetarians meals were offered - which is ok, but I was unsure if either had sufficient protein; plus the side dishes were all starches." accomodating check in staff, friendly flight crew ( a crew member was speaking tactlessly and was overfamiliar with passengers The crew should demonstrate flexibility by moving a screaming infant to its own seat with 1 parent Premium was very comfortable. Food was delicious. I had specific diet requirement and Virgin Atlantic ensured it was provided. Onboard crew was very friendly and caring. Extremely smooth journey. I wonder how upper class experience would be. Perhaps one day, I will try upper class. Pros: "The crew was friendly, the food delicious, and the plane itself in highest quality and state-of-the-art." Pros: "Crew are always top notch, free drinks are readily available and entertainment system is great." Cons: "The food portions and quality have definitely declined over the years sadly, as carriers cut costs no doubt." Pros: "The crew was so kind and amazing. They definitely made our flight great!" Cons: "The entertainment wasn’t working for most of the flight. We only got about an hour and a half of entertainment" Pros: "Great crew, good in-flight movies. Good food." Cons: "Wifi connectivity was poor for most of the flight. Plane was very hot it was difficult to sleep." Pros: "Amazing crew, excellent drinks and decent food. Very comfortable seat" Cons: "Everything was great" Pros: "Courteous and attentive crew from baggage check in thru baggage claim." Pros: "Crew was great !!!" Cons: "Seating in upper class is uncomfortable and bedding is not fresh." The crew members were great. The food was good. Entertainment was average - Could use a wider and better selections of movies and series. Cons: "Delta flies a lot of the CRJ planes, even on relatively longer trips. Traveling first class, the seats are a little wider than in coach and have a little more leg room, but calling it "first class" is a bit of an exaggeration. It's more like what coach used to be before the days of the flying sardine cans." Pros: "Cabin crew and entire experience was phenomenal. Cannot recommend Delta more!" Cons: "Nothing" Pros: "Great service" Cons: "Messed up my luggage in Atlanta. Gate said baggage was going to domestic. Ended up in international terminal. Added almost an hour of back and forth between terminals." Pros: "Crew, food, flight." Cons: "Could always use a wider seat. I just hate having my hips touching a stranger for the whole trip." Cons: "Plane was late taking off. Crew did not provide water when requested. They were busy with beverages that they could sell at a cost." Pros: "non stop flight" Cons: "Crowded, small plane. No air after people had boarded while fuel was being replenished (dangerous?), sitting at gate for 20minutes. This, after a 2 hour delay. Then a rough landing in Minneapolis- plane brakes sharply and suddenly, shuddered to a taxi rate of speed. simple snacks, not very good." Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "Worse experience ever, flight delayed, lost connection, many hours in phone trying to fixed and anyway lost the flight, spent so many time at the airport with the front desk so disappointed" Cons: "You guys didn't allow me to get in this plane and i missed my flight." Cons: "When we booked this trip via Kayak, we thought that we were booking on Westjet. Westjet knew nothing about the flight when we tried to check in." You can understand why Turkish Airlines are rated so highly; the whole experience was really good indeed. Aircraft itself was spacious, comfortable, and very well appointed. The crew were great, friendly and helpful. All round a great service and good value. Istanbul airport is also a remarkable place. Highly recommended. Cons: "being treated like a drug dealer at the boarding gate #312 and having passport / boarding pass checked several times" Cons: "The grilled cheese sandwiches. They've been in the menu for a while but my family does not enjoy them at all. Tuna sandwich on another flight was much better. Also lack of entertainment. They allow you to access it, then they turn it off. Is such a tease. Plane left late and kept us in very hot cabin." Pros: "Rapidly becoming my airline of choice. Great service, comfortable and on time. Relatively new fleet and not cramped. Puts other national carriers (including BA) to shame" Pros: "The flight and crew were fine. But I am frustrated with Turkish Airlines and their non-response about my tax refund for a flight I did not use." Cons: "I am disappointed that Turkish Airlines has not responded to my request for a refund on taxes for this same flight that I did not use on February 19 because I was sick. Dhaka-Istanbul-Tirana-Istanbul-Chicago. They made me pay double what I paid for the entire round trip flight to move this flight 2 days later when I was well enough to fly. I have called and written several times and they have not responded. I have used Turkish Airlines for years and this is very disappointing, I am entitled to the airport taxes that I paid and did not use." Pros: "They crew were very pleasant and polite. It was one of best flights I have had internationally" Cons: "The heavy turbulence but, that's beyond their control" Pros: "Again a good solid basic service with good food well prepared and agreeably served by a pleasant staff. Thank you" Cons: "Planes are a little small for a fairly long haul business service. Nice but small - so basic amenities." Pros: "Comfortable and uneventful flight - just the way it should be!" Pros: "You guys are blessed and best of all of time" Cons: "I didn't hate nothing it was the best" Pros: "Very friendly and willing crew." Cons: "Sound through headphones could be better. Hope to have free onboard internet one day!!" Boarding in NCL is really bad. I'm sure part of that is a directive from the airport that KLM can't change but part of that is due to KLM policy. NCL doesn't announce the gate of departure until 30 minutes before departure. However, when you arrive at the gate area, the gate agents file everyone into one long line and everyone boards from one line at one time. This line can stretch for 200m...easily. There is a separate line for groups 1 and 2 but you don't know it until you get to the gate area and agents don't announce/advertise it. Everyone else is grouped into one line. Are you in group 3? Doesn't matter...you board with group 5. Traveling with a child? Tough luck...you're stuck at the end of the line and board last. The last part is very annoying because none of the gates at NCL (with the exception of 1 used by Emirates) has a jetway. To board, you must leave the gate area, walk downstairs, walk onto the tarmac and walk up stairs to board the plane. Highly challenging if you're traveling with small children. That boarding process begs for a concession to allow people with children to board first because they will need extra time. But there is no such policy. Just a really horrible boarding experience all around. Cons: "I had paid for an upgrade to sit in the front of the cabin with extra legroom (row 14A). When I boarded a man sat it my seat. He had not paid for the upgrade, but the crew let him stay in my seat. I had asked him to social distance but he continued to sit right behind me bo matter which seat I moved to. He argued with the crew until they gave up and let him stay. They did not check his boarding pass or ask him to move to his assigned seat I found a different seat away from him but I don’t see the point in paying for extra legroom when the crew let’s people who haven’t paid for it sit it those seats. I felt harassed by the man and was very uncomfortable the whole flight. I am considering my next step, I think I should at least receive a refund for the upgrade I paid for." Pros: "Very friendly and responsive crew. Announcements from the Capitan and chief of flight attendants are very informative and comforting. Seat positions: very good leg room (even in economy)!" Cons: "Newer airplane, as 747s are kind of outdated now, especially for long distance flights. But overall had good experience with KLM" Pros: "Flight arrived on time" Cons: "No food provided "due to a strike the previous day". Not sure why this would impact on providing a sandwich or snack particularly when champagne was still available for first class passengers." Cons: "Half the screens were not working - crew were made aware but nothing was done. Vegetarian choices were poor to non-existent ; I witnessed crew insist to a passenger that there were no vegetarian options! They finally cobbled something together for him but not a pleasant experience" Pros: "The crew were excellent and seats were comfy." Cons: "Headphones for the entertainment centre.could have been better. Sound quality not great." Pros: "Onboard crew were nice and polite. Flight was on time (a rarity)." Cons: "The boarding crew was rude and unpleasant, the plane was boiling hot." Pros: "Great crew, comfortable seating with enough leg room." Cons: "Provide dinner before getting to joburg, instead of a snack. Flight arrives late so dinner would be appreciated" Cons: "We had 4 hour delay causing a stop over at 3am.
