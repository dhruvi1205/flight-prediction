I’ll never rate meals you have to pay for, at double or triple store prices, very high." Pros: "The flight delayed but the crew was really helping! Huge thank to the lady served in the economy class AS2239 on March 4th from Vancouver to Seattle. I was not able to catch the next flight without her helping." Pros: "Every thing was awesome It was the best airlines I had experience since I came here" Cons: "Nothing" Pros: "Crew was very friendly, funny, and respectful." Cons: "Couldn’t figure out how to get free entertainment, did not seem to be an option." Pros: "Very nice gate attendants!! And on flight staff were great!" Pros: "TSA pre-cleared me so I didn't even have to take off my shoes and there wad no one else in line in front of me. Alaska Airlines has comfortable seats with lots of leg room. We didn't get fed but there were many choices of movies and t.v. shows to watch." Pros: "Comfortable seats" Cons: "Delayed, may of been beyond the pilots control. Scrambled seating arrangements." Pros: "Boarding process need to be improved. Seat assignment is horrible" Cons: "It could have left on time or they could have told us they weren’t leaving and let us get some sleep." Pros: "I loved flying delta comfort. I’m going to do it more often." Cons: "We had to wait at the customs for nearly 1.5hrs, then pick up our luggage, then check in again!!! We were running and got on the plane 10 mins before the departure. Super stressful!!" Pros: "The people was relaxed and the flight attendant was polite and professional.. everything was on time" Cons: "Nothing at all great service" Pros: "I think they flew so fast. We could land almost on time even though we departed a hour late. Airplane was new and clean." Cons: "Boarding was chaos. They overbooked 25? 45? Anyway, they are in panic. They tried to request ppl to take next day flight by giving away 300 gift card etc. the ppl who were told there are no seats upset and arguing at the gate. Flight was delayed for one hour. Once we are on airplane, they are still shuffling seats around, so ppl cannot move forward. Just standing there for 10mins waiting for things to settle. Flight attendants did not give us a headphone. (I have a headphone for iPhone X so I could not connect it to their entertaiment system.)" Pros: "That was a treat since I don't expect the option to watch movies on short flights Also, thank you for the healthier snack items- keep moving in that direction please!" Pros: "good flight and pleasant staff" Cons: "no vegetarian option in business class therefore nothing to eat for me for whole flight. also sky lounge very poor" Pros: "Everything went as smoothly as possible.

I don’t expect much from airlines but I feel like I got a real meal on board (two of them!)" Cons: "We were delayed taking off and there were three screaming babies, but there’s only so much they can do about that." Pros: "The crew was polite and efficient. Moved very well around sleeping passengers sprawled feet. The shortcomings of the flight had to do with being in a tail section of an economy class in a packed transoceanic flight." Cons: "At the beginning of the long flight the cabin was chilled, which made me happy I had my hooded sweatshirt with me, but at the end it was hot and stuffy. There was no air regulation available from the seat, only light." Pros: "Staff was helpful and kind. Entertainment had variety." Cons: "Flight ran out of chicken meals fast, forcing the rest of the plane to have vegetarian instead. I was sat in 41G. Awkward seating arrangement. Worst seat ever! Super cramp, making a 9hr flight very uncomfortable." Pros: "The crew" Cons: "The served dinner 45 minutes before landing, kind of a waste at that point, 2 hours before landing would have been better. Also, parents need to parent their children instead of letting them bother other travelers while they watch movies." Cons: "It was Air Canada. Terrible service. Staff needs education on where to take travelers thru the immigration locations. Wasted time going to different locations and time is an essentence! Too many changes of staff from one location to another when it came with wheelchair assistance. One staff was on her personal phone!!! Had 3 different changes of hands then still did not get us to the right terminal, had to run to make the flight! Is that how you treat a 86 years old traveler?" Pros: "Service was excellent, food was good, everyone was friendly and nice." Cons: "Everything was OK." Cons: "Everything was great. Westjet is so much better than Air Canada!"

Cons: "I was not given correct information and being a very novice traveller did not check the information." Cons: "From Vancouver to Los Angeles no screen seats no Entertainment" Pros: "Seats had room. Entertainment options were quite good." Cons: "WestJet has lost its Chutzpah. No longer knows it’s identity. Food choices were terrible for a 5.5 hour flight, and the couple of okay choices they were out of very quickly. Crew was friendly enough but no sparkle." Pros: "Smooth trip." Cons: "No one would get a wheelchair to get to cart that was on different floor. Driver didn't volunteer to carry bags to cart." Pros: "Everything about the flight was fine except the delay waiting for the new crew." Cons: "The 90 minute delay taking off. The difficulty getting WestJet Connect entertainment software to work with my laptop. I finally gave up & watched tv on my phone." Pros: "We were happy to be seated in the exit row which gave us additional space. Although it was a direct flight, they offered drinks and snacks twice, when normally when flying I only see then come by once. I noticed Aiden seemed really friendly and kept a smile. Also when dropping off our luggage beforehand was a fairly speedy process." Cons: "Seats don’t lean back." Pros: "Crew did a good job, even with the long delays." Cons: "Plane was almost 2 hours late getting to LA. Started with the crew needing to clear customs in Vancouver. Delayed by 30 minutes....then the crew preboarded a sick lady and her travel companion. At some point crew decided she should not fly to LA, but the ladies wouldn’t get off plane! 45 minutes later and 4 RCMP show up to escort them off plane. Then we didn’t have any ground crew to get us off loading ramp. Finally got away 90 minutes or more after scheduled departure. Circled LA a few times before getting to land.... long flight with long delays!" Everything was fantastic, by far the best airline experience in Canada 🇨🇦! I can't praise the crew enough on how fantastic they where West Jet could learn alot from Porter about customer satisfaction Cons: "I booked this flight on Kayak. No mention at booking that this airlines has a ludicrous policy of charging $50 for a carry on bag!....wow!...last flight ever on Porter." Cons: "Would have been nice if we weren’t 2 hours late. Or if the people working at the gate were nice. Or if our bags weren’t hidden in some part of baggage claim with no announcement on where to find them. I’ll never fly porter again." Pros: "The snacks were great and crew was friendly!" Cons: "My seat was covered in crumbs, cleanliness overall could have been better." Pros: "On registration, the agent request as to pay for a handbag! It’s only on Porter that I have to pay for it." Pros: "The seats were comfortable and even roomy, compared to many other airlines." Cons: "Two minor drawbacks: (1) In the Porter lounge, where I was stuck between connecting flights, the cost of food was too high. (2) The weather buffets these small planes more than would be the case with jetliners." Pros: "Free bar nuts while delayed 10 hours" Cons: "Kicked us out of the airport when connection cancelled, NEVER fly Porter!!!! The horror stories are true as could be" Pros: "I love the in-flight food and drink service and the airport terminal comfort and amenities." Cons: "Porter is incessantly late every single time." Cons: "Justfly.com is awful and I wish kayak would stop sending customers to it. I will no longer use kayak because this is the second time my ticket has ended up being purchased through justfly."
