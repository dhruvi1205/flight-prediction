The rows of seats are WAY too close together and are very uncomfortable.

The rows of seats are WAY too close together and are very uncomfortable. My partners legs didnt even fit in the space in front of him and he had to splay his legs out into both directions in the other passengers areas. I can't imagine being bigger than we are and trying to fit into those rows. Unacceptable. Cons: "Announcements are delivered with too much speed and lack connection with passengers." Cons: "Flight experience was the way air travel use to be." Pros: "The dreamliner is an amazing plane. I really liked the window tinting feature it has." Cons: "We missed the connection between the two flights. They booked me for a flight the next morning. They did not provide voucher or reimbursement for food or lodging." Pros: "Friendly crew" Cons: "Food not provided. No in-seat entertainment. Late take-off on every single leg of my trip" Pros: "i was pretty comfortable being in an aisle seat" Cons: "didn’t love the lights coming on in the middle of the night" Cons: "Ordered vegetarian food was not in their system and had to eat yogurt only for a meal" Pros: "It wasnt bad" Cons: "I didnt like that you changed my flight last minute (20 hours before flying) from WestJet to Delta. And you changed it from a flight to Toronto to a flight to Seattle. Which made it an International flight, causing me to have to be at YVR airport earlier.." Pros: "Decent flight." Cons: "Entertainment system did not work. Also they said there is USB sockets at your seat but there were none." Upon boarding, the people at the gate were extremely rude, there were no outlets on a 6 hour international flight, there was no entertainment, all food and drink was purchase only (even snacks), and my seat reclining function was fully broken. The only redeeming quality was the flight attendants were extremely nice. This was by far the worst flight I have ever been on in my entire life I don’t know how international flights can’t have media screens to keep people entertained for the long flight. Ugh. Typical experience for budget airline. Boarding from KEF required bus transit from the gate to plane, so if you had "priority boarding" it was useless as it was simply a free-for-all when getting off the bus. But still no issues with getting our luggage into overhead bin so not really a problem. Was very apprehensive about flying Play, but the flight was fine. Nothing special, nothing horrible. Fair price to get from New York to Iceland. I wasn’t able to check in online the day before or the day of because their web configuration or business model idk. I arrived an hour early and check was closed and there was no one around to speak to and eventually was told there was no possible way to get a digital ticket despite I had no luggage to check and would have easily made it through security to boarding and had to pay for a new ticket for $330 ontop of the $169 I spend for the ticket and then I missed my rental car for $305 because I only arrived at midnight instead of noon that I was originally intended. All booked through kayak. I hope there is some kind of insurance from kayak because this was totally preventable had I not been blocked by play air from getting my check in and plane ticket. The staff was very professional, the places very clean. The legroom was a little bit tight but so worth the price of the flight. Very pleased! Next time, I want to book a stayover to explore Iceland :) The boarding process was easy, the crew was friendly and the flight was very smooth. There is a limited menu the food was tasty, but you have to purchase everything. The cost of the flight was very reasonable but everything such as baggage is extra. Play is a great budget airline. There are no TVs or chargers in the seat but there was more legroom than expected. Boarding and all staff that I interacted with were great. You have to pay for any and all drinks or snacks you might want on flight. Play is a great budget airline. There’s more legroom than expected, no TVs or chargers in the seat, all staff that I interacted with were great. Blood sucker budgeted airline. Charging after and after. No one should busy air ticket in this airline. Completely a scam and sucking blood. WestJet7.7 PLAY7.2 Book cheap flights from Hamilton to Paris Recent one-way flight deals Only flying one-way?
