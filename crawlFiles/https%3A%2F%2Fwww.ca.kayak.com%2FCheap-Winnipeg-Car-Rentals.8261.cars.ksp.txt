KAYAK’s top tips for renting a car in Winnipeg Suppose your tour of Manitoba coincides with the celebrations of a major event or festival. In that case, expect to experience challenges when driving your cheap car rental in Winnipeg. For instance, if you visit in the last week of February, you will find locals and other guests celebrating the Festival du Voyageur at the Voyageur Park. In late April, the town hosts the Rodarama at the Red River Exhibition Park. Usually, the streets leading to the venues of these events face closure, resulting in significant traffic jams in the city. Consequently, there are delays at the car rental locations due to long drop-off and pick-up queues. Endeavor to know the most critical traffic regulations before hitting the road in your cheap car rentals in Winnipeg. First, Canadians drive on the right-hand side of the road and overtake on the left. Secondly, understanding the right-of-way rules will save you from trouble with the authorities. For example, when two vehicles approach an intersection with no signs or traffic signals, both must slow down. However, remember that the car on the right has the right-of-way, and the motorist on the left must yield priority. You must also give the right of way to vehicles in a funeral procession. Authorities in Winnipeg are stringent when it comes to distracted driving. It is thus illegal to use any electronics, such as a mobile phone when driving. Lastly, it is prohibited to smoke in a vehicle with kids under 16. The legal age required for driving in Winnipeg, Manitoba, is 18. Nevertheless, some Winnipeg car rentals impose a surcharge policy for renters aged between 18 and 24. However, different cheap car rentals in Winnipeg might have other age requirements for specific car categories, particularly luxury cars, and SUVs. In addition, you must have a valid full class five driver’s license at the time of rental, which must be valid for the entire rental period. If you are from overseas and your valid driver's license issued in your home country is in a language other than English and French, you must get an International Driver’s License. A major credit card is required for payments. Renting a car is highly advised if you are visiting Winnipeg, as the city is truly best explored by car, especially because public transport is limited to a bus service in the city. Some of the great day trip options available to visitors with a car include Pembina Valley, Spruce Woods Provincial Park, and the quintessential lake town of Gimli. Gimli, in particular, at just an hour away from Winnipeg, is one of the most popular day trip destinations and its lakeside boardwalk is sure to enchant many a visitor. Picking up a rental car after flying into Winnipeg International Airport? Travelers looking to rent a car after landing in Winnipeg can find the rental car counters on the main level of the airport’s adjacent parkade.

Canada and Manitoba especially have some serious winter weather and in a flash the roads can be covered with fresh powder.

Luckily for drivers, Winnipeg’s rush hour is not even close to being as severe as Toronto’s or Montreal’s.

Eventually he somehow found a proper size car which worked well but had a coolant level warning light come on intermittently while driving. I reported this problem after it had appeared a few times and was asked to bring the car in and exchange it for another. Needless to say I did not appreciate the "welcome treatment" I had received. Other than that everything worked out fine 10.0 Wonderful Jul. 2017 Pros:The car got incredible gas mileage. It was a great car and we were very happy with this rental and the whole process of pickup and dropoff was very easy.
