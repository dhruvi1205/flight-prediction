KAYAK’s top tips for renting a car in Cancún One thing visitors to Mexico are often unfamiliar with is some of the unique driving laws in Mexico. Before visitors head out in car rentals in Cancun, it is important to know about the seatbelt laws in the country. In Cancun, the driver of a vehicle must be wearing a seatbelt. There is no requirement for passengers to be wearing a seatbelt. Since there are no laws in Mexico regarding car seats, if you are bringing children with you to Mexico, this is something that you should consider before traveling. It is always best to check with your rental car agency to see if they can offer you child seats for your trip. One of the fantastic things about car rentals in Cancun is the sheer number of places where you can find places for Cancun car rentals. While many people who arrive in the city will rent vehicles at the airport, there are plenty of other options places to rent a car should you choose to do so. For example, most hotels along the beach strip just to the east of Cancun offer car rental services. In addition to all those, there are plenty of locations to rent cars within the downtown Cancun area. Quite a few people that travel to Cancun want to visit the beautiful location called Isla Mujeres. Why most people will take ferries without taking Cancun rentals, you can take a rental car to Isla Mujeres if you wish. The only option for bringing a car to the island is at Punta Sam. The fare covers the vehicle and one passenger. Additional passengers will incur an extra cost. This ferry can be pretty crowded so arriving early is good to ensure you get a spot. Also, be mindful that there is limited parking for vehicles on Isla Mujeres. Whether exploring the beach, the nature reserve north of Cancún, or the city itself, a rental car can make all your trips easy and convenient. Whether vacationing with your family or on a business trip, make the most out of your time in Cancún and explore everything the city has to offer. Located within Cancún International Airport, renting a car at the rental center is very easy. With big companies like Hertz, Thrifty, or Budget, there will certainly be the right car for you. Shuttle buses bring you from the terminals to the car rental center. When driving through Cancún, make sure to pay extra attention when you are around public transport, as they are known to have their own street rules and may not adhere to what is actually permitted. Speed bumps are also a regular sight in Cancún, so make sure to take it a bit slow. Cancún’s roads can clog up during rush hours, so it is advisable to avoid them if possible.

At drop off they made you wait in the same line to return the car as the people waiting in line to pick up the car. Car return took 30 minutes. Also Kayak did not make Car insurance policies clear, and staff at Alamo were very aggressive at pushing their Insurance options. Their arguments with customers about insurance was one of the things slowing down the pickup/drop off line. 2.0 Poor May 2021 Pros:Nothing. They did not have a car even though we booked one.

I have rented cars in Mexico before, and this was by far the most miserable pickup experience. I'd rather travel on a donkey than rent from Europcar again. They are thieves trying to take advantage of tourists by upselling useless insurance products. They should all be in jail. 4.0 Mediocre May 2021 Pros:Drop off was super easy and streamlined Cons:Europcar in Cancun refused to accept my CDW, collusion damage waiver. Even though i had all the correct paperwork and even called the company who handled the coverage. Apparently even though it states they will accept CDW, they will not and they will give you a huge runaround as to why which isn't true, but when you are there, you basically have no choice but to accept whatever they charge for the extra coverage. My rental was $94, they charged an additional $250. This should just be charged up front to avoid all the hassle 4.0 Mediocre Mar. 2021 Cons:The price was total bate and switch charged me a lot extra even though I had proof my insurance and credit cards covered me in Mexico. We will never use them again. 2.0 Poor Mar. 2021 Pros:Quick transfer to the office Cons:They tried to rip me off by adding the unnecessary package, being very confused about what they try to charge with and forced me to cancel the booking. Very, very bad experience! 2.0 Poor Mar. 2021 Pros:Drop off was easy. Cons:I ended up paying $260 including insurance. Your website lies. 2.0 Poor Feb. 2021 Pros:Poor experience enough that I will never consider using Europcar again and reconsider Kayak as well. Cons:The staff lied to me immediately upon entering-which took a half hour. They told me that they had no contract with our insurance companies, American Express and State Farm , and as I result the company policy was that I had to buy full insurance. They also stated that the price quoted on the internet did not bind them as Kayak was only an agent. I have lived in Mexico for years and know that he was in fact lying to me. Ultimately we 'negotiated' a price that was twice what we were promised. I ended up with 3 insurances covering the vehicle and almost wished something happened to it. The gas tank was only a quarter full- I've never seen that.

As a solo female driver I always look at for my safety, the team was very respectful and made me feel safe and take care of! They gave me directions and even travel tips! 8.0 Very good Nov. 2017 Pros:Everything about Enterprise is great as long as you don't mind they are not located at the airport but just a bit north of the airport along the main highway. Cons:I had a seemingly very good deal for a Jetta including the mandatory liability insurance, but it turned out when picking up the car that the included insurance only covered the car up to 75,000 MXN and the coverage needs to be 2,500,000 MXN so that raised the rates by $10 per day and then I also had to pay an extra $30 for an extra day although my pickup date/time and return date/time were basically what I originally entered into Expedia. I'm positive that all the agencies are playing these monetary shell games so the only distinguishing factor across agencies is the level of service and how picky they are about the condition of the car when returned. 10.0 Wonderful Jul. 2017 Pros:I accidentally booked a manual transmission, and at the counter the man switched us to an automatic brand new car. Their airport shuttle was ready and waiting both times, they were friendly and very helpful. I didn't feel bamboozled by the insurance situation. It was breezy renting from this Enterprise.

Cons:Insurance is 3x the cost of the car rental. No E Plus points. No ability to make a reservation using E Plus points. This place licenses the Enterpprise brand - as do many non-USA locations.

It would be nice if the quote told you about fees instead of misleading you to think you’re getting a great deal. 2.0 Poor Jan. 2018 Cons:Our flight was delayed and they cancelled our reservation.

He then said the only vehicle he had on-site was a stick-shift, and that to retrieve the car I rented online I would have to pay ~$500 and take a shuttle to a different rental car facility instead of the airport. I ended up having to take a bus to reach my destination, and then had to use bikes, taxis, and buses during the course of the trip instead of a vehicle.

Cons:The price online was approx. $56 for the three days but when I got to the counter they told me that insurance was $50 per day so I ended up paying 3 times for insurance and had no clue! 4.8 Mediocre Aug. 2017 Pros:After driving the kia optima for 15 days, I came to appreciate it's acceleration, great brakes and comfort. Cons:Always check with your home insurance before renting in Mexico. The car was cheap to rent at 178.00 but mandatory liability added at $29 a day with $800 on hold on your credit card or $59 per day full coverage with a $200 hold on your card. Ended up paying $733 for entire trip. In Cancun there is no booth at the airport. Ace shares a space with Fox Car Rentals. Called them but they never sent a van. We finally walked our luggage across the street from the airport to find their office. The RAVs we rented were not coming until nightime. They only had one RAV in their inventory so they offered us the new Optimas. Every step was a long wait. The best part was the reliability of the car and returning it was quick. They did return us to the airport. Warning: If you get a traffic ticket in Mexico, police remove the license plate until you pay and show proof. You cannot return the car without its plates. Do not rent a car without plates as many policemen will stop you and demand a bribe. We met other tourists with this problem. We were targeted by police in Campeche because the car was a rental and we were foreigners. They nearly confiscated my brother's license and asked for a bribe of $108 which we paid. 6.0 Okay Aug. 2017 Cons:Upfront cost of a required insurance was not disclosed.

We paid for a 7 seater Dodge Journey new model. We got there and they said they have no 7 seater and gave us two rly old model Chevy car it was either that or a 5 seater. Okay we’ll make it work plus they added like $300 on Imsurance.. so on our trip we get a flat tire my husband fixes it so be it when we go to return the car we tell them and they charge us $200 for a tire that I cannot even exagérate the spare tire and other tires are all the same so $200 for a freaking tire that we couldn’t help popped on us while driving. So I am livid never in my life of renting cars are we made to pay for something that we had no control over. My mother has issues with the car rental too. We will never rent a car in Mexico again or from this company. Worst service we have gotten. The only reason we paid for the tire was bc we didn’t want to miss our flight and had to get to the airport. 2.0 Poor May 2021 Pros:We cancelled the rental car.

I liked having unlimited miles for our roadtrip. Cons:I was surprised that insurance cost almost double what I paid for the rental. It'd be nice to know the insurance prices upfront. Huge sticker shock since my personal insurance wouldn't cover a rental outside the US. In Cancun our flight arrived late at night. I knew arriving late at night might be problematic, but Dollar had reassured me that someone would be available to help us and that they'd shuttle us from the terminal to our vehicle. Well, it was 12:30AM and I couldn't find anyone at or near the terminal to shuttle us. I called 6 times, over 30 minutes, to the number provided and it would just ring endlessly. We finally had to pay for a taxi to take us to the Dollar location about 1/2 mile from the terminal. Finally I was able to talk to someone and drive away with a vehicle at 1:30AM. 9.6 Wonderful Jul. 2017 Pros:All employees were polite and friendly and spoke emough English to explain our various options for the required Mexican car insurance. The car was clean and available more ot less immediately when we got through the check-in process. No shuttle bus required as the business is just a 1-minute walk across the street grom the airport terminal building. The prices were the lowest we found. Cons:Checkout paperwork took a lot longer than you can believe even though nobody was in line ahead of us, so allow yourself extra time to make it to your flight.

When we arrived at the Thrifty counter, they told me they didn’t have a minivan for me. I said I made a reservation, he told me that since I didn’t prepay for the rental(which I didn’t know was an option) they didn’t have one for me to rent. We then had to scramble and try to find new transportation to/from the airport to our hotel. I will never rent through this website or Thrifty again 9.2 Wonderful Mar. 2018 Pros:Pick up and drop off take ages. It staff were accommodating and vehicle was great 2.0 Poor Mar. 2017 Cons:I was very upset that Kayak advertised the rental as being $8. We reserved the car at this price, and arrived in Cancun to be surprised with a whopping amount of insurance fees which amounted to over $400. If we refused the insurance and used our credit card's insurance for the car, then we had to pay $1300.00 to the rental car company, which obviously made no sense. Absolutely infuriating to be surprised with this tremendous rate differencce, and found ourselves in a position of helplessness last minute. Would never rent again here. 10.0 Wonderful Mar. 2017 Pros:They communicated clearly via email before we arrived. The rental was inexpensive. I used my Amex card for insurance and there was no pressure to buy more insurance. They simply placed the $2500 hold on my card. The car ran fine and we had a great trip! We took lots of pictures when we picked the car up and had no problems with the drop off.

The rental fee was incredibly low, but they screw you on insurance, and if you haven't been diligent in taking pictures/videos they try to screw you on the return too. I get free rental insurance through my credit card. To use this though and waive Keddy's insurance I had to put down a deposit of 9000USD. When I said yes to this, they said I also needed a signed letter from my bank in Canada confirming they would cover the full value of the car. When I couldn't produce this (as we were in Mexico at the time) they said I had to pay for their insurance. When we brought the car back, they tried to charge us for fuel and for damage. The only reason they couldn't is because we had pictures of the fuel gauge and videos of the damage from when we picked it up. Also, to print a piece of paper, as in if you want a paper copy of your contract, its 11USD 2.0 Poor Nov. 2021Waited for over an hour to be Ickes up at Eurocar, never told Fox was the name not Kety.

A set of wheels essentially makes hard-to-reach places more accessible: crowd-free ruins, remote beaches, and seldom-visited sinkholes suddenly look very doable. John Hecht 15 June 2023 Just so it's clear, you can get by just fine in Cancún without a car. Buses, passenger vans, and taxis can take you to most places you want to go. Having said that, you simply can't beat the convenience of having your own ride, especially when pressed for time or when traveling with children. A rental affords you the freedom to stop wherever and whenever you like, and in a place with so many natural wonders and hidden gems, we're sure you'll agree it's worth every last peso.

The minimum age requirement is 18, however, motorists aged 18-24 must pay an underage driver fee, which costs an additional $11-15 per day. Now that hurts! Types of cars available for rent in Cancún Cancún abounds with rental car outfits, meaning you can easily find any vehicle you need, no matter the size, shape, or color. The options range from economy and mid-size autos to minivans and full-size SUVs. An economy car will serve you well for city driving and squeezing into tight parking spaces. Off-road vehicles prove useful during the rainy season if you plan on tackling the bumpy jungle roads. Rates for economy car rentals usually start at about $40 per day with liability protection and unlimited mileage included. Shop for online deals and discounted weekly rates. Airport pickups in Cancún More Car Rental Options Cancún has an ample offering of rental car centers in the hotel zone and downtown if you prefer not to shell out for an airport pickup fee. You’ll find a slew of car rental agencies and their fleets in and around the Cancún airport’s four terminals. Shuttle bus service transports customers from the terminals to the nearby lots; most companies also provide transportation to their branches in the hotel zone and downtown. The big players like Alamo, Hertz, and Europcar stay open around the clock at their airport locations. Driving your rental car outside Cancún It’s possible to take rental vehicles to nearby Isla Mujeres and Isla Cozumel aboard car ferries departing from Punta Sam and Calica. The fares cover the vehicle and one passenger. You do not need a car for either place, but some visitors find it convenient for exploring remote areas. Alternatively, numerous agencies on the islands rent golf carts, buggies, and scooters, which essentially serve the same purpose as a car. Most rental companies in Cancún do not allow you to take their cars across Quintana Roo’s southern border into Belize, however, you can do so through America Car Rental, which provides both insurance coverage and the permits you’ll need to enter Belize, or if you prefer, Guatemala. Taking a car across the border can be somewhat expensive though. What to know about car insurance in Cancún Mexican law requires you to have third-party liability coverage, known in Spanish as daños a terceros. In most cases, your insurance policy at home does not cover driving a vehicle in Mexico. If asked at the counter if you want to add extra coverage, keep in mind that major credit cards provide some form of collision damage protection. Call your credit card issuer to ask specifically what the coverage entails. Some companies in Cancún run promotions that include complementary theft coverage, but it normally comes at an additional cost. Driving in the city: what you should know Under a new law, both drivers and passengers are required to use seatbelts in Mexico The speed limit on federal roads is about 65-70 mph and it’s around 45 mph in the city’s hotel zone. Do not exceed 25 mph when driving through busy pedestrian areas. If stopped by traffic police, remain calm and politely ask why you’ve been pulled over. Most officers will let you off with a warning, however, some bad apples may try to shake you down for a bribe, which is illegal. They usually give up if they see you jotting down their name and badge number. Whenever possible, avoid heading into the hotel zone during rush hour between 7:00 am-9:00 am and 5:00 pm-7:00 pm. Parking your rental car in Cancún You'll sleep much better at night if you can stay at a hotel with parking. If you must leave your vehicle on the street overnight do not leave any valuables in it and you might want to double-check that the spare tire is still there in the morning. Parking in and around downtown’s busy Parque de las Palapas can prove difficult at times, otherwise, you should have no problems finding spots throughout most of the Centro. In the hotel zone, however, parking is far more limited. Many of the north-facing beaches have small lots and you’ll find free public parking at Playa Delfines and Playa Caracol. If you’re catching a ferry to Isla Mujeres from the docks at Puerto Juárez, El Embarcadero, Playa Tortugas or Playa Tortuga parking costs about M$100-200 (around $5.56-11.12) per day. Gas and charging stations When you roll up to the pump, the gas station attendant will ask if you want Magna or higher-octane Premium; the latter usually costs at least US$5 per gallon. Always check that the pump is set at zero before the attendant begins dispensing gas. Most gas stations accept debit and credit card payments but have cash on hand in case there’s an issue with the terminal. It’s customary to leave a M$5-10 (around US$0.28-0.56) tip for the attendant. For electric vehicles, you’ll find charging stations at the airport and various points throughout the hotel zone, including Golf Puerto Cancún, Fiesta Americana, and Live Aqua. Seasonal driving tips For the most part, Cancún has sunny weather year-round, so visibility is rarely a problem. The rainy season runs from May to October and can make navigating certain dirt roads difficult. Hurricane season normally lasts from June to November, and you should refrain from driving in storms that bring gale-force winds and flooding.
