Was an old plane tho, and the controls for movies , seats etc were archaic" Pros: "I had 4 sectors except the first one 3 of them was with unfriendly cabin crew not smiling at all not responding the calls." Pros: "Business class setup Bar Staff" Cons: "Being seated 5 rows and a bulk head away from my wife. Configuration of Two class A380 business class is at the back of the plane with all that increased movement and you have to wait for economy to exit before you can get off. Your diluting the benefits guys for economy profits." Pros: "Love the A380 - the sheer size of it allowed for more personal space. Consequently, it was a much more comfortable flight." Pros: "Professionalism of flight and ground crew. Movie & entertainment selection. Overall cleanliness of aircraft. Better comfort due to wider seating." Cons: "The fact that this was the shortest flight of my trip - Wish my journey started this way." Pros: "Didn’t get this flight as we were so delayed." Pros: "Good space and entertainment. Crew was excellent. Really enjoyed it." Cons: "Food. It’s plane food wasn’t impressed." Pros: "Staff were quite attentive. All requested were promptly fulfilled" Cons: "Service took a long time once on the flight. We left Sydney at 7pm and didn't receive any food or drinks for at least an hour and a half." Pros: "A380! Overall is good. I liked a bag of accessories including eye mask and socks." Cons: "In flight food in Arabic style, my brother didn't like much of that styled food. But I'm OK with it. They provided light meal ( "pide" lamb/veggie filled bread or choice of fruit). The veggie pide was a bit weird. But overall, the food was not so bad." Cons: "Staff tried to accommodate my vegetarian requirements but with limited success." Pros: "The prompt service of the staff and comfort of the plane." Cons: "Warm snacks instead of cold pastry." Cons: "Seats recline too much making difficult to get in or out because of the seat in front of you" Pros: "Everything was great" Cons: "More choice of movies, and more choice of translations languages for movies.

We requested few times and they wouldnt allow." Pros: "I liked that they enforced the rule on boarding by rows as many airlines have given up trying to do that and its a free for all especially with certain groups of people." Cons: "Food was alright, i had better food in Bangkok airways" One of the worst airlines I have used. My recent flight was delayed taking off, but what was worse is that they allowed us through the gate, got on the bus to the plane to be told in that the plane would not make a the direct flight to London due to fuel shortage and it had to make a stop in another location to pick up fuel. Absolutely shocking!! Can't work out of the A320neo was just short range on that they literally did not have enough fuel at the airport to fuel the plane. Tashkent to London is not a long haul, I have done this before, so therefore I am going to assume it's the lack of fuel at the airport. Not the best staff, they all seem to just go with the flow, no organisation. No control, like herding sheep in a pen at the gate, same when getting off the plane. No control. Food was ok but staff were rude. Better to travel in and out of Tashkent using Turkish airline. I have booked my return flight but will cancel and accept the hit and 1 stop to ensure peace of mind with Turkish airline. Terrible service and plane Just 3 toilets for over 150 passengers No screen A flights of nearly 8 hours. A disgrace It was friendly and I enjoyed the flight very much. We booked business and they offered nothing during the 1 hour flight Cons: "Sick (flue/high temperature) person was allowed to board the plane. Don't allow sick people on a plane during coronavirus epidemic." Pros: "Super nice" Cons: "To give tooth brush and tooth paste for long flight." Pros: "Yes they was super nice." Cons: "To give tooth brush and tooth paste for the long flight." Pros: "I must have chosen business class ($43?) and it was very comfortable. Very short flight but still served a snack." Cons: "Left about an hour late and took a VERY long time to get luggage after arrival." Pros: "Safe flight clean airplane" Cons: "Intertaimnet none of the tv in my row was working:-( no movie game or music for 12 hours of flight" Pros: "Friendly crew." Cons: "Planes old, and even business class seats are not very comfortable." Cons: "The transfer in Istambul was very tight on the way back I literally had to run to get to the flight" Pros: "Crew was good but could be better...timeing was very good." Cons: "Food, entertainment" Pros: "The Turkish Airline crew are treat you as guests not as customers." Pros: "Boarding couldn’t be easier. The crew is very attentive and nice!" Pros: "The flight went well with no complaints." Cons: "With Airlines in the US charging for almost everything except the air you breath while on their plane I hate to complain about the meal Turkish provided free but a couple of the items on the tray could have been better." Pros: "Superb entertainment system" Cons: "The flight back from Dublin to Istanbul was awful, it was crowded, very warm, no air to breath." Cons: "Service was terrible, crew was rude. Flight was delayed 2 hours leaving Tel Aviv and my luggage was not here when we arrived. They let us wait two hours for luggage before telling us it wasn't going to make it in. Frustrated and disappointed! Ground security in Turkey was rude and took my sons skate board which we had flown to Israel with and back to turkey, then they told us it couldn't come with us to miami although we flew Turkish both directions with no problem. In the end gate staff went and rescued his skate board from security as he got to the flight crying his little eyes out. Communication was terrible and staff was rude!" Pros: "Entertainment and food was good." Cons: "Flying to Tel Aviv (I missed my chance to review), my tray table was broken and the USB wouldn't charge on any of the televisions." Pros: "I have been travelling on the Turkish airline since years and it is definitely the best" Pros: "The lost my 1 checked bag of luggage somewhere between tel aviv-istanbul-frankfurt!! Filed a report at Frankfurt Airport but it was filled with all my essentials and some valuables and the airport staff didnt seem to concerned in helping me.... To clarify, my experience through Kayak has been fine! However this whole ordeal has left a very sour taste in my mouth...i still dont have my luggage. They couldnt track it l yet....maybe you can help or forward this message to the appropriate authority. It is extremely important to me :/ Thanks, I still like kayak :) -addam rhodes" Cons: "See literally everything above" The Crew have no idea about the food they're serving the passengers. The Crew MUST be instructed before each flight about the menu that will be served to the passengers, whether the food is vegetarian or non-vegetarian, whether it is Halal, Kosher or not. Cons: "KLM lost my suitcase and did not deliver it until three days later... They refused to compensate me for having delivered the bag with broken articles inside (A pair of Rayban Wayfarers!)" Pros: "Due to business I travel allot so I deal with allot of airlines. This is by far the best airlines I have used. Excellent crew and airport staff. I don’t think words can express how satisfied I am with this airlines and airport. The nicest people and great service. Clean and modern aircraft. Going to try flying only with KLM from now on." Cons: "Nothing" Pros: "I was sorted on Row 3 and the drapes kept hitting the back of my head." Cons: "Move the drapes a few more inches back." Pros: "Almost everything, especially the crew." Cons: "Don’t feel like anything should be better to be honest" Cons: "The flight from Manchester to Amsterdam has been delayed which led insufficient time for me to transfer to HK" Cons: "The flight was a bit delayed, but the airline handled it incredibly well. I was put up in a great hotel with good free food and caught another flight the next morning." Cons: "Flight 2 hours delayed, started boarding but had to wait on line 10 more minutes on boarding ramp for plane door to be opened, upon landing in Dublin had to wait on tarmac for anther 15 minutes for stairs to arrive and be connected to airplane. Then had to wait another hour for checked luggage...." Pros: "the trip was excellent and comfortable. LOved the windows that shaded out rather than the having to pull down the plastic blind. entertainment on board top notch screen huge One hostess , Helen was absolutely fantastic and the best I ve had on my many trips. I will recommend KLM whenever I can" Cons: "the headrest is hard. Apart from that- all was fine" Pros: "Checkin 1a at Schiphol had long lines, and no seperate counters for just bag drop. My family and I had to wait for 50 mins, to do a bag drop which in,y lasted 1 min! Flight was delayed, without proper announcements." Cons: "Seat pitch could've been more. At least let us know via Whatsapp that the plane is delayed, or at which belt the bags would come out. This basic info was lacking."
