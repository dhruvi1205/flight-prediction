Staff are kind, polite and welcoming. Passengers experience a comfortable low stress environment, Customers feel they are well cared for by a highly trained and professional staff. I will shout from the rooftops when I get back home, "Japan Air is the way to go!" Cons: "American airlines, No entartainment, no hi hello from the crew, no food, not even water... Funny guys, why the have flight people inside the plane :) domestic airlines are always joke compared to the world domestic or overseas...." Pros: "Just excellent. Excellent crew, excellent food, excellent aircraft, and excellent leg room. No recommendations." Pros: "Great seat, cabin crew was fine."

Pros: "Spacious leg room." Cons: "The food is average. Could be much better. Eg, serve eggs like omelette for Breakfast. Only one choice . The other choice could be Jap menu vi differing it’s s Japanese airline. Flew JAL 2 yrs ago too. Food was not good. Also , toilets could be cleaner. There’s always a pungent smell." Pros: "Very smooth ticketing and boarding on Tokyo to Manila." Cons: "In LA terminal, instead of the gate number the airport labeled my flight as “TBIT.” Not being local, I had no way of knowing it meant Tom Bradley International Terminal. I stayed near another gait that had international flights, and it turned out the gate was clear on the other side of the complex, which is obscured by construction. If I hadn’t asked one of the workers there I would have missed my flight." Pros: "Dinner (coach) was pretty good. Earphone, screen for entertainment are very nice. I liked the charging slots for each seat. Crew is polite and friendly." Cons: "The second meal (light lunch, i think) had dry shredded chicken."

Even got upgraded to the extra leg room for free" Cons: "The extra leg room seats were naff, I like getting comfy in a chair and these ones were not. The screen was too far away and the arm rests didn’t move. Also, due to my partner having to swap seats, I was sat on my own next to strangers. They slept the whole way, so the crew never disturbed them meaning I missed out on food and drinks, even when asked" Pros: "Crews were great. Seats space could be better ... overall caring & attentiveness of crew members make a lot of difference." Cons: "Food! 40 years ago Singapore Airlines was second to none in my book! Now I feel like I was away somewhere and Singapore Airlines has changed dramatically....Must be a lot of moving pieces have changed that I was wondering again during my journey whether I was really flying Singapore Airlines..." Cons: "The rebalance was worst I've ever encountered I was actually scared I prayed many times 4 yo get home safely I was not impressed with my last flight n also why were We delayed coming from manila we turn back many times n I had only 50 mins to catch my flight to Perth if we had landed wen we should hv I'd hv time to buy some gifts I'm.glad that Philippines airlines will fly direct yo manila from Perth come March n I'll use them from now on as it's a few times in the years gone that things has happened to me I forgave ur airline but now i not need to as hv other airline to fly n my darling come here 3 or 4 times each year but will use Philippines airlines URS sincerely Trevor frahm" Pros: "I liked that on the longest leg of my trip - I had an entire row to myself to stretch out. Im old, things like that are important...along with compression socks...haha!" Cons: "I think the food - I dont know exactly what, because we're on a plane - but I think it could be a bit more appealing? More greens, colors? Not sure, but it was okay." Pros: "I liked the size of the cups for drinks: smaller than usual." Cons: "You could train some of your crews to behave more polite to the customers like they do in the Japanese airlines.

Overnight didn’t work from Bos to Doha and had to eat food without light Good and comfortable flight Helpful crew Decent food and drinks Everything from start to end was good and easy plus clean i enjoy my trip in qatar airline Was humiliated at Doha airport, treaded like a cattle class traveler, I hold platinum pro status with AA and I don’t fly economy even domestic but was made to travel in the middle seat in economy class and boarding zone 3 and was denied lounge access at Doha airport. Never was humiliated like this before. Pros: "The check-in crew in Chicago was very nice and efficient. The flight crew on-board were not friendly, they were very curt and rushed, and did not go out of their way to be helpful." Cons: "Friendlier staff during the flight. Better food for breakfast. The connection port for my headphones did not work...I would not have been able to watch movies if I hadn't brought my own single connection head phones."

No tv and entertaiment for adults" Pros: "The friendly and helpful service." Cons: "There was a long line by my seat to use the restrooms." i saved my points for more than 10 years in anticipation of treating myself to an upper class fight to and from london on virgin atlantic. i was shocked to find what you consider “upper class” on the dreamliner. it was, at best, a mediocre business class accommodation. it was tight and not that comfortable, with nearly no personal storage. everything was cramped and just generally disappointing. once i lucked into a 1st class upgrade to europe on lufthansa - a magical experience that found me reluctant to sleep, lest i deprive myself the joy of their setup. i expected something similar from virgin atlantic, but i could not have been more wrong. it will be the same arrangement on my flight home, but at least i know what (not) to expect. to be clear, this is only in reaction to the physical accommodations. your people were, and always are fantastic. The Virgin seats in business are quite narrow and also don’t recline enough in a seated position. When you make them into a bed, it is quite hard, despite the thin cover and cannot be adjusted at all, in comparison to business seats in other airlines. Virgin need to upgrade the quality of their seats. The food on this flight, I had an AVML was not good, normally though I have found the food to be good. Other than that, the staff were very attentive and pleasant during this long 14 hour flight. Pros: "People were friendly. Flight was comfortable." Cons: "Staff incorrectly assessed documents needed for visas, and told us we were incomplete and needed to return home. Instead of looking up policy, we were denied boarding mid-flight, missed a wedding, and had to spend three days in London instead of our destination. Also, we got bug bites during the flight that turned out to be from bed bugs, which followed us home and caused much frustration for months." Pros: "Crew was great !!!" Cons: "Seating in upper class is uncomfortable and bedding is not fresh." Cons: "Very cramped aisle seat and I kept being knocked by passing crewe including knocking over a cup of water." Pros: "Very friendly crew. We boarded about an hour before so we were ready to go well before time." Cons: "The economy seats are not that comfortable and the screen for entertainment is sometimes difficult to use." Pros: "There was one stewardess that really made the trip feel less "restricted" in the way she would greet, talk, serve, and just being what I always experienced good international flight staff to be. I wish I was able to get her name so I can praise the airlines for hiring such a great staff like her." Pros: "The crew were all excellent" Cons: "Dinner choice was poor. Starter was just a few salad leaves." Pros: "The business class seats are the best we’ve had. Plenty of room, nicely laid out, good organization design. The blankets were fluffy and very comfortable. Crew was super attentive and friendly. For such a long flight, it was very pleasant, will highly recommend." Pros: "Everything except the food" Cons: "The food is atrocious. Even if I have to pay to upgrade my meal, I would..." Cons: "Flight was freezing. Crew was overly concerned about my tree nut allergy. Been flying for 40+ years and this was the first time any one has asked...appreciate it but they went overboard" Pros: "The crew rocked!!!! Professional and fun. We enjoyed the music." Cons: "WiFi didn’t work well. Still great flight." Pros: "extra legroom of comfort plus zone" Cons: "Bordung process runs smoother now that the order is made clear ahead of time. In jfk they did not have the columns marked “comfort” “priority? “Main 3”, etc, like they had at Reagan arpoirt in DC" Pros: "Crew was very kind and entertainment was good when available" Cons: "WiFi in all flights" Cons: "Virgin Atlantic has had better days. Living off of a long gone reputation. Great staff but old and worn out planes. Code sharing has done them no favors!" Pros: "It was quick" Cons: "Horribly shaky. Thought I was going to throw up. The male flight attendant came off as rude. Just happy I got off the plane alive because it was rough" Pros: "Arrive early. On time departure." Cons: "My row 34 D did not have entertainment - had to move to another seat and row." Pros: "Everything on time, friendly and helpful attendants" Cons: "Why does boarding have to happen with several other flights, gets confusing. Have other flights board at a different time or from another gate far away so customers don't get confused" Pros: "Staff was friendly." Cons: "During boarding, the sign wasn’t updated after Zone 1. I was watching the board from a distance while on the phone, waiting for Zone 4 to come up. Fortunately, I heard them say “final boarding” over the intercom; otherwise I could have missed my flight." Pros: "Very grateful they moved me to an earlier flight when mine was delayed due to weather. Impressed with entertainment options."
