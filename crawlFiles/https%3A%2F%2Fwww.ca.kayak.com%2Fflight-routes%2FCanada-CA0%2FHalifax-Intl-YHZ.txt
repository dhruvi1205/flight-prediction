We thought we could buy something. The coffee was good."Read more about WestJet Cons: "No Food to buy available on board. We thought we could buy something. The coffee was good." Cons: "The food could have been better. I don’t mind paying but some nicer, healthier choices would have been nice. It is airplane food so no real surprise. :)" Pros: "Excellent pre Boarding service and announcements; reasonably comfortable seats; great landing;" Cons: "There are never gluten free options in the snacks; there were no entertainment systems on the plane - that's not important to me but perhaps it is to others." Pros: "Crew were fairly attentive, have experienced better. Liked the Canadian entertainment options, even if very limited." Cons: "Seats were okay, the plane is really showing it's age. Movie selection was very limited, and very dated." Cons: "Wake people up when serving anything.. I have seen in some other airlines that one is provided with a sticker to place on your seat to show if you can or cannot be woken up" Cons: "The baggage restriction was not good at least one Checking should be allowed" Pros: "The check-in process was very easy and friendly. The flight attendants seemed nicer than other airlines." Cons: "There was an almost 4 hour delay that WestJet is taking no responsibility for, and their online chat agents lack any compassion or understanding. Also received an email saying the aircraft changed and there would be a seatback flight entertainment system but there wasn't." Cons: "Minor point. They boarded the plane very early. We got to the gate 1/2 hour before departure, and were almost the last ones to board." Pros: "Dry accommodating staff all around. Thank you" Cons: "More space between people. Not much you can do I understand that. So overall great" I had checked in online the day before but was instructed to collect our boarding passes when we arrived. I am not completely comfortable using the automated Kiosks and always enjoy the nostalgia of speaking with someone when checking in for a flight. Upon doing so however, we were immediately asked,"did you check in online already?" To which I replied, "yes, but we were asked to retrieve our boarding passes upon arrival." She then said, "that's what those machines over there are for. We really encourage people to use those." That unfortunately sparked a series of shortness and overall poor behavior in my opinion from the woman who checked us in. I understand it was early in the morning but I am always excited to experience flying and that interaction has unfortunately left a bitter taste in my mouth to the point I will forever now hesitate to book with Porter again. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Cheers, JD Everything was fantastic, by far the best airline experience in Canada 🇨🇦! Unlike our porter connection this was great , smooth 2minutes at check in not 90 mins Food wasn’t great but it’s plane food , staff were great They really communicated well advised well in advance of a delay. Contacted to tell me it was almost time to go and to do a check in. Porter, like most airlines, need to improve their baggage policies. In reality, there are no longer 'cheap flights' because passengers pay exorbitant baggage fees. Cons: "I was ripped of by baggage check!! They sold my a basic fare, which is 20 less than standard, but never told me I had to check my back which cost 40! Ended up costing me more!! I was furious" Pros: "On time; easy boarding check-in" Cons: "It would be such a nice touch if you could set up coffee and breakfast snack in the terminal waiting area." Pros: "Efficient check in. Liked the shuttle bus service from subway to airport." Cons: "As expected this is a commuter flight so very stripped down in terms of amenities. Tight plane seating and those overhead bins just barely accommodate the carry on." Cons: "That don’t let you go standby on an earlier flight with a “basic” fare, even when there are empty seats. Not clear when you purchase through Kayak." Pros: "The crew was very attentive and the seats are comfortable. The waiting time is horrible...they are always late!" Cons: "I like landing at Billy Bishop, it is very convenient and not too crowed but lately the common lounge has gotten so crowed that you can only seat on the floor. The flights are usually 2 hrs delayed sometimes 3 or 4 hrs delayed! so never plan on having a connecting flight on the other side of your tr" We could not check in early, I think because we purchases through a third party, therefore once we got to the airport, no seats together, and only middle seats. Will never do that again Pros: "The staff did their best with controlling passengers who were a bit difficult. Overall a good experience." Cons: "Implement the row by row getting off the plane. The flight back to Vancouver people were standing in the middle isle grabbing their carry on and waiting to get off the plane." Pros: "Quick boarding. Clean plane." Cons: "Disgusted that baggage wasn't included in the ticket price. I've taken the route 6 times, and this is the first time baggage wasn't included in my ticket. Seats were very small and cramped, with very little room. Not enough space in the overhead lockers for baggage which made cramped seats even more cramped. The TV didn't work either so was a long flight with little entertainment." Cons: "Good tasted so bad, you should try to improve it." Cons: "There was a delay of 4 hours to board from Montreal to Paris. with not any justification or valuable reason from the crew." Pros: "The crew was so accommodating! They took great care of us and provided us with a meal, drinks, and coffee in the morning. Such a great experience, will definitely fly with them again!" Cons: "The seats could have been a little comfier!" Pros: "Crew was good" Cons: "Old plane... not much room for legs and seating are uncomfortable! No personal entertainment système! Poor flight" Pros: "Crew very good, food was good, middle seat of 3 could have been a little more comfortable." Pros: "No turbulence." Cons: "Fees for luggage included just as it used to be !!!! 60 euros for a luggage is way toi ecpensive !!!!" Pros: "The crew was amazing. They were super friendly and attentive. Amazing service!" On time departure with early arrivals. My last flight arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule which was great due to my long commute home 3+ hours. The cabin crews on all 3 flights were great. See ya in 7 days Air Canada Flight was late, then they kept us in the plane because the crew wasn’t available to let us out. So if you have a tight connection it will become impossible. Was surprised the plane was a turbo prop. These are much noisier than jet planes. Plus; Easy check in. Organized and efficient crew. Minus; Legroom on plane. Wiped down armrests and tray table with a Clorox wipe and wipe showed more dirt than I thought was there. LAX-YYZ was a horribly old A321. Terrible experience for a premium market. YYZ-YHZ was a new A220 which was MUCH better. But still I find AC miles behind Delta. Flight left on time, Landed early. Very pleasant experience all round. Boarding was a breeze and the attendants at the airport were very helpful Not to long of a trip, crew where very good. We had a significant illness at the last minute. Air Canada was unsympathetic and rude and refused to give us any credit on our unused ticket. Ran wonderfully and smoothly roundtrip. Could not have asked for more from the staff. Flight delayed by 4 hours but no communication. With passengers until after the posted departure time became apparent the flight was not going to board even close to on time. Flight was sent canceled. The absolute most useless staff I have ever witnessed. Utterly careless - literally could not care less. 100% never using this airline again. Poor communication at the check in counter and boarding gates. Other then the screaming baby the flight was fine, nothing special Check in experience was smooth, and the flight attendants were courteous and friendly. Very positive experience overall, thank you all! Flight arrived late but other than that everything else okay Great price for a new plane. Only offered water which we knew.
