Cons: "There could have been more leg room provided for the aisle seat passenger."Read more about Alaska Airlines Pros: "It was a quiet early morning flight that went smoothly." Cons: "There could have been more leg room provided for the aisle seat passenger." Cons: "Great flight and their service was great. Looking forward to my next flight with them." Cons: "My flight was cancelled and instead of getting a cancellation notice, I received a “your flight has been updated” email which indicated that my flight was changed from Wednesday to Friday. Unacceptable!!!" Pros: "The crew was nice and we enjoyed the inflight entertainment" Cons: "The flight was a hour late and we almost missed our connecting flight they actually had to hold the plane for us" Pros: "I dont like there service." Cons: "Alaska airlines did not provide assistance and I requested to assist to re check in my baggage. I did not receive any assistance to the airlines staff. This is horrible service and not happy to the alaska airlines." Pros: "Every aspect of the trip was above our expectations, comfortable seats, delightful staff, good food and on time service." Cons: "Paid for and reserved a premium seat 6 weeks before flight but got reassigned to a non-premium seat upon check-in. I had to call customer care for a refund of the premium upgrade. No more live TV unlike the old Virgin America." Pros: "Being in the service industry I completely understand how important customer service is! Alaskan airlines have asked their staff to use the customers name as much as possible. It was great to see that when I was borning my name was used. This was not an ordinary monotone thank you that every single person gets. The “ Have a nice flight and Thank you for flying with us”, was cheerful and upbeat and I was greeted with a smile. During my flight the customers names were used as they were asking to take orders as well as passing out food as though you were known person to them. I am not a regular flyer, I did not use my credit card, the fact that they used my name means Alaskan has a trick to the trade that others don’t.. I am not a regular flyer, I did not use my credit card, my flight attendants knew my name. What an amazing experience." Cons: "That there wasn’t anyone to meet us at the gate and we had to wait on the plane." Pros: "Excellent crew. very friendly. No attitudes" Cons: "they were not ready for us at LAX. We spent 20 minutes in a remote corner of the airline waiting for a gangway so we could go down to the tarmac and wait another 50 minutes for buses. No gate, no buses, just standing around. Terrible planning for our arrival" Cons: "Delaying a flight by 2 hours for crew issues is ridiculous and even more do not alerting me to the change before I was at the airport. Terrible" Cons: "When we booked this trip via Kayak, we thought that we were booking on Westjet. Westjet knew nothing about the flight when we tried to check in." Pros: "The flight attendants were amazing. 12 people had a connecting flight and they brought a shuttle bus. You dont see that kind of service any more 10 stars for that" Cons: "Super small plane." Pros: "It was Ok. Some short delay but over all not too bad. Just didn't like the fact I always get seats next to the toilet" Pros: "Excellent service in most every respect! Boarding was easy, accommodations were quite ample, food was great, and the entertainment was plentiful." Cons: "Slight problem with making my seat into a bed, which wasn't fixable. Movies were good, except for the trailers before and after each, which seemed to take forever! Didn't get the seats my wife and originally booked with China Southern/Delta, but the substitution was quite adequate! Problems with checking in on flights, as neither airline seemed to be able to deal with this split ticket! But they tried very hard to make thing up to us, which goes a long way to making us feel like we are valued customers!" Pros: "- great customer service - friendly staff - Positive energy" Cons: "- No room in the seats - No food served on plane - Crowded -" Pros: "Airline and airport staff were great" Cons: "There was no time to eat. Nothing other than snacks. The time allotted was *barely* sufficient to get from gate to gate. We were starving when we got to our destination." Pros: "Delta is professional and safe. The best fares ever." Cons: "Lack of food/snack choices. Seem like a shortage on ice." Pros: "I, as a tall man, was allowed to move into an exit row with no additional charge. The flights were not full." Pros: "love that each seat now has a USB connection to charge your phone" Cons: "headphone jack to watch movies shorted in and out constantly" Pros: "The crew were friendly enough and willing to serve." Cons: "The seat could have been thicker and softer for greater comfort--instead, it was thin and flimsy. There should also be greater space/pitch between the rows of seats." Pros: "Crew very friendly" Cons: "Lufthansa continuosly treats repeat customers like milk cows. The new ‘light fare’ is a genius way to charge the same as before with ZERO customer support." Pros: "The food was really good! I don’t expect much from airlines but I feel like I got a real meal on board (two of them!)" Cons: "We were delayed taking off and there were three screaming babies, but there’s only so much they can do about that." Pros: "The crew was nice." Cons: "The infotainment system could have been better. My system was not working for the first 3 hours and the sound went out after 2 hours of use. Also my blanket was not clean." Cons: "It was Air Canada. Terrible service. Staff needs education on where to take travelers thru the immigration locations. Wasted time going to different locations and time is an essentence! Too many changes of staff from one location to another when it came with wheelchair assistance. One staff was on her personal phone!!! Had 3 different changes of hands then still did not get us to the right terminal, had to run to make the flight! Is that how you treat a 86 years old traveler?" Pros: "Service was excellent, food was good, everyone was friendly and nice." Cons: "Everything was OK." Cons: "Crew was not very friendly, the lack of customer service is evident." Cons: "(1) The captain collected headsets 30 minutes before landing, causing us to miss the last 15 minutes of a movie. Why? (2) Very long cues for toilet use. (3) The baggage took more than half hour to arrive. (4) The chair in front of me reclined very far (more than those on its sides), making it very hard to eat, get up, or read. Need better maintenance." Pros: "The crew was great!" Cons: "I was traveling with other people and we were not seated next to each other. And I got sick from the chicken." Pros: "The aircraft was great. A bit wobbly on take off and landing, but overall spacious and comfortable seating. The seats had many position options which was amazing. Meal service tableware was clean and pleasant to use. Food was also great. Also a very wide selection of entertainment options! Also, good flying from the pilot’s crew. Flight was on time." Cons: "The servicing crew in the business cabin was inexperienced and unrefined. The flight attendants seemed to just want to “get it over with” with questions like “are you done?” The attendants wanted to take our drink order as soon as we got in without giving us a chance to settle into our seats and kept hovering over us until I had to ask her to give us a couple of minutes. The airline did not stock enough snack and ran out mid flight. We had to wait for the next meal service which was not fun. I ended up getting a sweet drink just to get by. Internet, which was paid, was so slow that I got tired of watching it trying to load the pages and gave up. Eventually, the connection completely stalled even though I still had over an hour remaining of the 4 hour package. I used maybe an hour of the total purchase. Total waste because I couldn’t get any work done. Overall, I did not think this was an experience worth a business class ticket." Cons: "The food could have been better. I don’t mind paying but some nicer, healthier choices would have been nice. It is airplane food so no real surprise. :)" Pros: "Flight was late, crew didn't do anything to expedite boarding and it took the longest I have ever seen to board a plane." Cons: "Boarding process was slow and chaotic" Pros: "The check-in process was very easy and friendly. The flight attendants seemed nicer than other airlines." Pros: "Very nice crew and good snacks. Quick boarding." Cons: "Newer plane with TVs. There was an app for entertainment of you wish to download." Cons: "Minor point. They boarded the plane very early. We got to the gate 1/2 hour before departure, and were almost the last ones to board." Pros: "Dry accommodating staff all around. Thank you" Cons: "More space between people. Not much you can do I understand that. So overall great" Pros: "Crew was very friendly and helpful" Cons: "This was the first time in 37 years that I have flown so i had a little motion sickness but that has nothing to do with your crew or airline. This experience was very good thank you" Cons: "From Vancouver to Los Angeles no screen seats no Entertainment" Pros: "Unreal service by all WJ employees. Great service getting my 87 year old mom to and from everything." Pros: "Crew were very good. The economy seats were "ok". Food was good and the service was very good." Cons: "Entertainment didn't have enough new movies to watch. The leg room could've been better." I had checked in online the day before but was instructed to collect our boarding passes when we arrived. I am not completely comfortable using the automated Kiosks and always enjoy the nostalgia of speaking with someone when checking in for a flight. Upon doing so however, we were immediately asked,"did you check in online already?" To which I replied, "yes, but we were asked to retrieve our boarding passes upon arrival." She then said, "that's what those machines over there are for. We really encourage people to use those." That unfortunately sparked a series of shortness and overall poor behavior in my opinion from the woman who checked us in. I understand it was early in the morning but I am always excited to experience flying and that interaction has unfortunately left a bitter taste in my mouth to the point I will forever now hesitate to book with Porter again. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Cheers, JD Everything was fantastic, by far the best airline experience in Canada 🇨🇦! Porter uses the intelligent and logical way of boarding a plane - from the back. Unlike our porter connection this was great , smooth 2minutes at check in not 90 mins Food wasn’t great but it’s plane food , staff were great Nothing , two weeks of dealing with booking glitches on porters side , as our main international carrier was fine ,we were assured. When we got to check in everything would be smooth , we were confirmed there would be no issues, guess what happened? After an hour and a half at check inn we were told there was technical glitch involving payment we may not be able to fly , which would have set off a catastrophic chain , the undue stress on my family was unbearable . travelling in 14th of April and now we are in 17th , I have not received my lost/delayed bag... this is very bad and the worst part is their call center is not able to see where is it!!!! Cons: "Honestly, even if the aircraft was delayed, there is nothing one can do and just be patient. Lunch and dinner vouchers were issued, that was well appreciated!" Pros: "Friendly crew wick deplaning" Cons: "$35 for a carryon is ridiculous. Do you really want your peer airline to be Spirit? Quote your all in price for fares."
