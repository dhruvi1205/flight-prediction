The rented iPads had to be given back almost an hour before the end of the flight." Pros: "Andrew and James the flight attendants were fantastic. The flight crew was great. Very smooth flight." Pros: "Cool to get bonus points for the trip" Cons: "Would have been nice if flight attendants walked the aisle regularly during the red eye flight, I was very thirsty and in a window seat with 2 sleeping people..." Pros: "Everything was superb! The airline I prefer did a great job! The seats, the food selections, the staff - everything!" Cons: "Nothing. Everything was just perfect!" Pros: "The plane was clean and the ticket was cheap." Cons: "Boarding process was needlessly complicated — just assign everybody a seat beforehand. Gate agents were rude. Seats are very uncomfortable and it’s difficult to sleep on red eyes. It should be prohibited to fly 737s cross-country." Cons: "They shouldn’t charge for snacks and offer some form of entertainment in an almost 6 hr flight." Pros: "The crew was very happy and welcoming." Cons: "We were late and I missed my flight. I was told Flt 452 from LAX to JFK is notoriously late. Also, there could have been more updates about our delayed arrival." Pros: "I just really like the customer experience with Alaska. I dislike flying, but Alaska makes things as painless as possible." Cons: "I don't think anything could've been better, it's not possible to be comfortable in coach, but we all already know that." Pros: "Comfortable seats and smooth red-eye transcontinental flight." Cons: "If there weren't a 15-minute delay due to maintenance." Pros: "Nothing" Cons: "Should have let me cancel, or gave me credit for another flight, my schedule changers and I asked 2 months in advance, they could care less" Pros: "Complimentary snacks and drinks." Cons: "Broken seat back, broken tray table, audio input didn't work." Pros: "Crew was nice, and pilot was helpful and got us there early." Cons: "My screen for movies didn’t work, and the level of comfort was... almost none. I would’ve upgraded to more room, but for $55? When I’m already checking a bag for $30? On top of flight price? Too high, expected JetBlue to not jam pack all the seats like the exit aisle.... for long flights, not again." Cons: "Newer plane with less issues. Wasn’t comfortable at all and should be cleaner." Cons: "Boarding took a long time. We were waiting in the tunnel for longer than usual." Pros: "JetBlue's free Wi-Fi and comfortable seats really make JetBlue a domestic airliner unlike any other." Pros: "Service" Cons: "Seat cushions need to be replaced! Plane seats were not cleaned either" Pros: "4 hours late. Many people missed connections. We were up over 24 hrs by the time we got home. Had to check out of hotel & sit at airport for 8 hrs. Rough trip home after great vacation. Head of flight crew was very rude, likely because she was so tired. Rest of crew was fine, though I'm sure equally tired. Plane very comfortable though." Pros: "You can always count on JetBlue for good snacks and free WiFi." Cons: "But the snacks and free WiFi is not enough to payback the delayed departure experience. Just a week prior, my JetBlue flight was scheduled on time and then three things delayed thre flight for three hours right before we took off and now this! I was told it was due to needing to replace a crew member from another delayed flight. How can that affect so many people? The seat was also super uncomfortable and the back of the cushion was rolling forward, which made it hard to sit for that long. we also didn’t have a gate when we landed so that added on an extra 30minutes. Really disappointed." Cons: "My family and I decided to travel with JetBlue instead of cayman air because they had the tv’s for the kids entertainment. Was very disappointed when they didn’t work the entire flight home" Pros: "Despite being a smaller airline I must say I’m completely floored by how much I enjoyed my flight with JetBlue! The free WiFi is a game changer compared to the greedier airlines that charge through the roof for it and the staff has been incredibly kind. ‏ Also, the flight attendants were really sweet. I watched them diffuse a few situations that most people would have ended up making worse. Not to mention this is the only airline that actually OFFERED to assist me getting on the plane. I sometimes request assistance, but I really needed it last night and they offered without a second thought. I had only come up to the desk to ask about reprinting my ticket. As soon as I went up to the desk to ask about reprinting my ticket, they immediately asked if I was ready to preboard. The man who helped wheel me out of the plane at JFK was very considerate as well and asked if I wanted to go to the restroom before going out to the gate. He wheeled me all the way to the car where my husband was waiting. Every member of the Jet Blue staff I met this weekend was exemplary. If I can help it I will always fly Jet Blue when I fly nationally." Cons: "The gate was not as clean or neat as other gates. My flight was also delayed by two hours." Pros: "The crew was very friendly and it was a day fast flight." Cons: "No back of seat entertainment." Cons: "Flight delayed 3 hours, then a seats were very cramped and uncomfortable" Pros: "Security and checking in was quick and easy! Crew members were understanding and accommodating." Pros: "There was an incredibly large passenger next to me and I was essentially afforded only a quarter of my seat. It is not really fair for anyone to have to sit next to someone taking up twice their seat." Cons: "When we booked this trip via Kayak, we thought that we were booking on Westjet. Westjet knew nothing about the flight when we tried to check in." Pros: "The flight attendants were amazing. 12 people had a connecting flight and they brought a shuttle bus. You dont see that kind of service any more 10 stars for that" Cons: "Super small plane." Cons: "the flight was delayed and so I missed my train home" Pros: "Crew was nice and welcoming" Cons: "Well, if our plane had been leaving on time it would've been superb." Pros: "Actual flight was great!" Cons: "Delays were awful, and the ground crew was unhelpful in helping people find earlier alternatives to the delayed flight." Pros: "Zee was our flight attendant and she was absolutely wonderful. Personable, attentive, and she made sure each and every person on the plane was comfortable and happy, going so far as to move solo passengers to empty rows so they could have more space. I wish she could be on every flight I take." Great flight, comfort, and staff. Prefer tv in back of seat but watching on phone will do Pros: "Friendly staff and the support they offered to my mother who needed a wheelchair." Cons: "I would have liked to have had WestJet internet and entertainment access. It was not offered on our flight from Toronto to Fredericton." Pros: "The fact that military personnel and retired military personnel and their spouse can check in luggage for free. The check in crew was also very courteous." Pros: "Rotten stuff cancels out the good doesn't it. Be great if you could take some courses from Stephen Covey as you are missing some skills sets in hospitality. And stop being so cheap with the 3rd rate old old movies!" Cons: "I did not appreciate having the second row to the last on my 2nd plane coming back - I only had a turn around time of 20 minutes to catch my third Westjet flight. When we asked if the plane would wait for us - your crew just laughed in our faces." Pros: "Great, friendly crew in this scenic trip across to Victoria. Nice new aircraft operating this route." Pros: "Cheerfulness of WestJet employees." Cons: "Seat comfort; seats hard. Person next to me average size but still spilled into my seat with “man-spreading” and shoulders." Pros: "Efficient crew and reasonable seating" Cons: "Need more legroom or a device to fold passenger legs for the flight duration..." Pros: "Crew was good. Seats need to be updated and are confining. I appreciated being able to disembark through front and rear door." Cons: "More space between the seats." Cons: "No plugs to charge phone. Though flight was budget class, other airlines does it better when it comes to food." Pros: "The crew were great! Ingrid was so sweet as soon as I stepped on board !" Very short flight so the limited space and lack of entertainment were no issue. Crew was friendly and the flight was very punctual. Baggage claim in Prague was lightning quick. Simply the best way to get nonstop to Europe. if you’re lucky, there’s clear skies with views of Arctic or the aurora at night. Paid extra for the seat to have more leg room they changed the aircraft and gave me the last seat in the cabin and I couldn't even recline the seat backwards due to the wall behind. Asked the crew member she said she will check as she has to accommodate other people and never came back or moved me elsewhere. Very uncomfortable seats. Was shocked they were that bad in business class The crew did an awesome job in helping parents with infants, resulting in a quiet trip for all. Never happened. Lufthansa canceled numerous flights. Had to stand in line at Frankfurt Airport for 6 1/2 hours to rebook. Had to bypass Paris. Flight was delayed without reasoning or ample notice. Missed my connecting flight and was not given the rebooking information or new boarding pass until I had to ask multiple times. Connecting flight had no room to store my carry on luggage. Frankfurt to Washington DC on Lufthansa served a snack on the flight that was veal cutlets. Very risky choice to serve on board. I chose not to ate them for a variety of reasons but I hope Lufthansa chooses differently in the future. It never happened. How could you ask me to write a review of something you are not aware of never happened???? Waited 7 hours at the airport and now I have no way to locate my luggages because they were checked with tags to a flight that was delayed twice and then canceled last minute.
