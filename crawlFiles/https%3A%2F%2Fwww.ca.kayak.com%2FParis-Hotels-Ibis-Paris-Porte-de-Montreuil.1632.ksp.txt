The employees avoid contact with the customers. They always on their personal phones even with a line of customers. Horrible service and management. They tried to accuse us for a broken toilet in the room. Luckily we took pictures on arrival. We showed them to the whole staff including the hotel manager before they were convinced. Shame shame shame! A 2.8 Poor alitalaguna, Jun. 2015 Pros:The staff is friendly. Cons:Bathroom was dirty, full of fungus to a level that the white tile looked black. Also found pubic hair on the floor... The smell of the entire place will make you nauseous. The location is too far and in a dangerous area in Paris. This place shouldn't even be functioning. I had a similar experience w/Ibis hotel in Brussels. In summary, please don't stay there.
