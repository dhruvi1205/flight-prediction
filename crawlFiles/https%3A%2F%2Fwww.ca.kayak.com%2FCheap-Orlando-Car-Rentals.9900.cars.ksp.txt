KAYAK’s top tips for renting a car in Orlando Enjoy the flexibility of having car rentals in Orlando to explore all there is to see in the city and nearby areas. One of the main attractions in Orlando is Walt Disney World. With cheap car rentals in Orlando, you can get there from downtown in around 20 minutes, as it is about 15 miles away. As for Universal Studios Florida, about 10 miles from the city center, a car rental conveniently gets you there in about 15 minutes. Take advantage of the freedom of having your own vehicle to discover some of the nearby beaches, lakes, and state forests, as well. The car rental agencies located in the Orlando International Airport (MCO) terminals are highly-rated and have convenient on-airport sites. Enjoy the comfort of not needing a shuttle bus to get to your Orlando car rental, right upon your arrival. Make your way to the R1 level of the parking garage to check in, there are two parking garages (A and B) where you’ll locate your rental vehicle. There are plenty of car rental services with vehicles available to pick up directly from the airport, such as Avis, Hertz, and Budget. When you book cheap car rentals in Orlando through one of these airport agencies, you’ll be on your way to exploring the city and its attractions in no time. Like other larger cities, there can be a significant amount of traffic in Orlando, especially around rush hours. In this case, to avoid getting stuck in a jam, stay away from the main entry and exit highways around work commute times between 7:30 am and 9:30 am, as well as 4:30 pm to 6:30 pm. The roads known to get clogged are mainly Interstate 4, the segment of U.S. Route 17-92, as well as Taft-Vineland Lane along the southern end of Orlando. Roads in Orlando are generally catered to tourists, which makes navigation easy. Taxis in the city can get expensive and hotel shuttles to various parks can get crowded, depending on the season. If you plan to visit any of the parks or attractions, a rental car gives you the option of packing extra snacks, drinks, and other essentials without having to carry it on your person. Most major car rental companies are located on-site at Orlando International. They can all be found on the A-side and B-side of the Terminal on the Ground Transportation Level (Level 1). If you decide to use a car rental company that is not at the airport, most companies provide free shuttle transport from the airport to their off-site locations. You must have proof of insurance in order to drive legally in Florida. You can obtain insurance through the rental company, but, to ensure coverage, check with your personal insurance before traveling. When driving through rainy conditions, windshield wipers and headlights are required to be on. Seatbelts are mandatory and all children under the age of 5 are required to be in a federally approved car seat. Speeding fines are doubled in construction zones, so navigate with caution and be mindful of your speed. You can expect traffic delays during rush hour at 7:30-9:30 am and 4:30-6:30 pm. Toll roads are the best way to avoid delays. Most rental cars will already come equipped with a SunPass sticker so that you can move through the toll without stopping. If the rental company does not provide the pass, be prepared to have plenty of quarters ready for each toll booth. 25% of our users found rental cars in Orlando for C$ 41 or less Book your rental car in Orlando at least 1 day before your trip in order to get a below-average price Off-airport rental car locations in Orlando are around 70% more expensive than airport locations on average Mini rental cars in Orlando are around -31% cheaper than other car types, on average Orlando car rental experiences: the best tips from KAYAK users Insights shared by verified travelers who rented a car in Orlando Learn how KAYAK collects reviews and tips from users. Verified travelerNov. 2023 Renting in Orlando: I prefer the off-property car rental places such as Advantage Car Rental at the MCO Airport. Access is easy and you will avoid the poorly designed and crazy-busy on-property traffic pattern. Local Driving: When you drive on I-4, just realize that you will be stuck in heavy traffic going west toward Lakeland or Tampa or east toward downtown Orlando - often stopped or crawling - for 20 to 30 minutes. Stay in the middle lanes(s) when possible. Once this thinking is kinda built into your travel estimate, you're good! Drivers aren't generally as aggressive as, say, Boston Rt 128 or Florida East Coast I-95 drivers, yet there are LOTS of them! There is always quite a bit of traffic on I-4. Polk Parkway, John Young Parkway, and other alternative routes are usually good for travel and busy but not maniacal. Verified travelerOct. 2023 For UK residents I have only one tip. Remember although they do have rules of driving similar to the "highway code" in the USA, the first rule seems to be "ignore all the other rules". Drive carefully! Lol. BrennaOct. 2023 Book through Kayak, prices are the best. Traffic can get busy on the roads leading into Disney so make sure you keep your car with some extra gas in the tank. Verified travelerSep. 2023 Yes. Global staff instructed on toll situation and recommended "pay by toll" and showed how to program GPS to select routes to avoid tolls. Worked well. Verified travelerOct. 2023 Avoid the toll roads in Florida. Use your map apps to find the other options. Verified travelerNov. 2023 Driving was excellent.... stay with the flow of traffic ....alot of police BrendaSep. 2023 Get the toll pass in the airport. Easy, DanyaSep. 2023 Rent in the terminal. Fast transaction in sixt Verified travelerOct. 2023 Easy and comfortable driving experience in Orlando Verified travelerOct. 2023 The way out of MCO is a bit tricky. For Germans/Europeans: be reminded that there is no law in the US to drive on the right lane if possible, so everyone can use every lane at any speed. Be aware of your surrounding, especially on your right. Also, be aware of forks that split the lane so always read the signs above. TaraSep. 2023 Don’t use York. Also, it may be a lot easier to use one of the companies on site, rather than the ones needing a shuttle. However, if the shuttle worked and actually picked them up, it may not be so bad. Verified travelerSep. 2023 Know the rules. Especially turning right on a red light. I already knew this from years ago. But would be useful to inform renters when picking up ChristosNov. 2023 think about tolls- how much will you use them? to avoid unnecessary prepaying maximum daily rate if a care rental employee pushes you HaroonSep. 2023 Text for pick up and wait inside. The bus takes forever and it’s big snd Red so you’ll see it arrive. Kathy and RossNov. 2023 Orlando is very busy. Watch for the tolls. Many are unmanned and you need Sunpass or will be billed. Verified travelerNov. 2023 Rent from budget, off airport at this parking garage place, rather than from other companies or places.

Verified travelerNov. 2023 Lots of traffic in Orlando. Verified travelerOct. 2023 Tolls don't forget about tolls. Verified travelerSep. 2023 ace rent a car was very straight forward and much easier and conviennent than the services that are offered at the airport. However the quality of their cars might not be as great. Hertz gave me an incredibly hard time and I suspected a lot of aggression and racism from the employee who was helping me with my reserved rental. I had ended up leaving hertz behind to go to ace. ShreyasSep. 2023 Check you don't pay for anything extra that you didn't want. Hiring from the UK for USA, normally everything in included, so no CDW etc is needed. They will try and sell it to you. slovely08Oct. 2023 Be careful of other drivers they can be crazy sometimes with speeding and weaving between traffic Verified travelerJun. 2023 Don't panic about using off sight vendors. There is a spot at the terminal for you to wait for you car company to pick you up and the prices are cheaper. Oh, and if you think about it. You don't have to drive into the airport after. You drop the car back to them offsite and and they drop you off at the airport. LOVED that!! Verified travelerAug. 2023 You can completely avoid tolls - try using waze Under there is a sign or cars coming you can turn right even when it is red Roads are wider - check speed limits Make sure that you take pictures of fuel at start and finish , any damage , and mileage if your mileage is limited . Verified travelerJun. 2023 Driving was in Orlando was OK. I ended up buying a phone mount (even though phones hook up and have GPS screens in rig). They offered a Sun Pass for tolls at $12.99/day. So glad I got it! Lots of toll roads and worth its price! MauricioJun. 2023 Have to be careful about the sun pass (tag) roads. Our car navigation system had tolls disabled so it was good as we didn’t use it BillyAug. 2023 Orlando was pretty easy to get around. Many tolls around the city and traffic at times. But very spacious roads TomJun. 2023 Refill the gas tank BEFORE you get close to the airport. Stations near the rental office have exorbitant prices. AmyJul. 2023 Book with an agency that doesn’t make you wait in line at pickup, especially for a late-night flight. Verified travelerJun. 2023 I highly suggest the Sun Pass it was very convenient and worth the extra cost. GAILJun. 2023 Orlando traffic can be very hectic, my apple car play navigation was a lifesaver. Verified travelerAug. 2023 They were very nice and we checked in quickly. TomJun. 2023 Advantage is ok. Can’t beat the price PaulJun. 2023 Use Hertz gold plus to avoid lines JeffAug. 2023 Stick to renting gas or hybrid vehicles. Orlando does not yet (as of August 2023) have sufficient quantity and availability of EV fast charging stations to justify renting an EV. Verified travelerJun. 2023 Busy and sometimes hectic with traffic and construction in the area. There should be a more equitable fee for using toll road like the turnpike. DavidJul. 2023 As expected heavy traffic conditions, extended traffic lights, and tolls. please review the navigation systems to ensure these settings prevent you from being overcharged. Verified travelerAug. 2023 Driving in Orlando was fine. Folks are generally lay back in driving which is fine with me. It just takes long to get anywhere Verified travelerAug. 2023 Look good in both mirrors changing lanes. Other cars pass on both sides. (Not legal in the Netherlands.

Verified travelerMay 2023 Driving in Orlando is relatively easy but you do need satnav. One consideration is whether or not to buy a “toll package” at $12.99 per day. Apparently some tolls don’t take cash as the relevant cash booths are not manned so you could subsequently be hit with significant administration charges + relevant toll charges each time you go through the toll if you can’t pay cash at the booth. The big consideration is how often are you likely to pass through tolls to the locations you are going to. I would not take the weekly toll package with the benefit of hindsight as the only tolls I encountered during my stay were on main/very busy roads (e.g. to/from airport) where the toll booths were manned. S MMay 2023 Driving in Orlando or that matter Florida is always a pleasure as they make much wider roads and the condition of the road is also much better than most of the other cities. ChristineMay 2023 Driving in Orlando was very easy, the freeways and iocal roads are very lovely! jennyMay 2023 Rent from FOX. Close to the airport and very reliable. Verified travelerMay 2023 If you use debit the $250 deposit money is not credited to your account for 3 business days. BrianMay 2023 Go with a reputable company.

Instead of kindness and empathy, we were treated with a cold and indifferent 'sorry, it's the system, nothing we can do, have a nice day and good luck'.

Our only concerns were as follows: 1) the line to pickup was very long compared to all the other rental companies 2) the rep at the counter spoke softly and didn't do a good job explaining what we were paying for Other than that, prices were good, rep was friendly, the vehicle was wonderful, and we would definitely book again. 2.0 Poor Oct. 2023Change the negotiated price charging an extra USD 15 for a “mandatory” 3rd party insurance Back 1 out of 229 Next Dollar 5.1 Fair1285 reviews Most popular Cleanliness 6.5 Comfort 6.2 Pick-up/Drop-off 4.9 Value for money 5.5 4 locations in OrlandoShow locations from C$ 54/day View deals Dollar reviewsCar rental locations Locations in Orlando 1 Airport Blvd +1 866 434 2226 Monday 00:00 - 23:59 Tuesday 00:00 - 23:59 Wednesday 00:00 - 23:59 Thursday 00:00 - 23:59 Friday 00:00 - 23:59 Saturday 00:00 - 23:59 Sunday 00:00 - 23:59 View deals 10100 International Drive +1 866 434 2226 Monday 08:00 - 17:00 Tuesday 08:00 - 17:00 Wednesday 08:00 - 17:00 Thursday 08:00 - 17:00 Friday 08:00 - 17:00 Saturday 08:00 - 17:00 Sunday 08:00 - 17:00 View deals 4270 Aloma Avenue, Ste 174 +1 407 205 0297 Monday 08:00 - 17:00 Tuesday 08:00 - 17:00 Wednesday 08:00 - 17:00 Thursday 08:00 - 17:00 Friday 08:00 - 17:00 View deals 7400 International Drive +1 866 434 2226 Tuesday 09:00 - 14:00 Wednesday 09:00 - 14:00 Thursday 09:00 - 14:00 Friday 09:00 - 14:00 Saturday 09:00 - 14:00 View deals Filters Wonderful (58) Very good (55) Good (2) Okay (52) Fair (2) Mediocre (68) Poor (242) Show reviews that mention get the carcar i reservedcar was cleanrented the carfriendly staffcustomer servicegreat experiencenever rentShow more Reviews 6.0 Okay Nov. 2023Desk clerk refused to give us the car reserved (we saw several of them in the lot on our way out), tried to upsell a larger model, said our luggage wouldn't fit in it (SUV), etc. Finally I said we just want the car we reserved and he let us go, but the $$ was higher than originally reserved. 10.0 Wonderful Oct. 2023Great rental company, convenient and affordable. 2.0 Poor Oct. 2023The price was right. The car was an older model. The car needed maintenance and was never done. We had a flat tire notice and thus happened back in July. But nothing was done apparently. The car was not safe and it spoiled our vacation with lack of confidence in the car for use and the tire issue. So disappointing. 2.0 Poor Sep. 2023Headlight out on third car - first one got sent back from exit gate after we loaded luggage as it needed oil change. Very unresponsive staff to my needs 1.9 Poor Jun. 2021Entire process a scam. Three people in front of me in line were also unsuccessful in getting the company to honor their reservation. I was told that I couldn’t pick up my car (even though I paid in advance) because the magnetic strip on my credit card wouldnt work in their broken machine. They refused to type the numbers in manually, use my chip, use another card, or use Apple Pay. I have Used the magnetic strip on my credit card at with other vendors before and after the interaction. I left this location questioning if they ever had a rental available for me in the first place, and if they were just trying to turn me away. The person before me was told they can’t pick up their reserved car (which they also paid in advance for) because they didn’t have a plane ticket departing from their drop off location. This company takes your money with a deposit and then refuses to honor their commitments or refunds. This is clearly something that happens frequently, as all of the associates were combative and appeared to be prepared for an issue with every guest that approached. I have rented cars countless times in my life and I have never experienced anything like I have with dollar/thrifty. If you continue to accept reservations for cars at this location, you will continue to get customer complaints, refund demands, and disputed credit card transactions. 5.9 Fair Jun. 2021The agents always try to push insurance and other extras making the lines long and very slow. The kiosk area is noisy, dirty. It's time to pet some confortable chairs, AC, make it a resonable for customers coming from flights all around the world.

The service agent told us he did not have one available. He said he would upgrade us to a mid-size SUV. He gave us a relatively new GMC Terrain. That vehicle had gear selection push and pull buttons in a row at the lowest point in the centre stack below the infotainment system. These were difficult to reach and very awkward to use. I’m 63 and have driven many, many different vehicles in my life, including race cars, and this one was by far the most awkward and uncomfortable vehicle ever! Typical GM plastic surfaces in the drivers cabin as well…tsk, tsk GM. 4.0 Mediocre Nov. 2023very good car. Very long queue at pickup (Hertz and Sixt had no queue). Seems that everyone took a long time because they were being pressured into buying extras. I was offered "full insurance", although supposedly had prepaid this, without clear explanation, and other extras (full tank, tolls which i barely used). Paid way more than expected. Couldn't argue after long flight and wait. Will definitely never rent from Budget in Orlando again. Likely to avoid Budget overall, and Kayak if it leaves me open to extras. Wrote to Budget asking to at least explain charges, but they just told me it was all as per the (incomprehensible) receipt. 10.0 Wonderful Nov. 2023Good prices and they actually did what they said they would do … Which is a new concept for rental companies apparently. 2.0 Poor Oct. 2023he ai Back 1 out of 214 Next Hertz 6.0 Okay937 reviews Cleanliness 6.5 Comfort 6.5 Pick-up/Drop-off 5.9 Value for money 5.9 24 locations in OrlandoShow locations from C$ 50/day View deals Hertz reviewsCar rental locations Locations in Orlando 1 Airport Blvd +1 407 859 8400 Monday 00:00 - 23:59 Tuesday 00:00 - 23:59 Wednesday 00:00 - 23:59 Thursday 00:00 - 23:59 Friday 00:00 - 23:59 Saturday 00:00 - 23:59 Sunday 00:00 - 23:59 View deals 1 Grand Cypress Blvd +1 407 494 7352 Monday 08:00 - 17:00 Tuesday 08:00 - 17:00 Wednesday 08:00 - 17:00 Thursday 08:00 - 17:00 Friday 08:00 - 17:00 Saturday 08:00 - 17:00 Sunday 08:00 - 17:00 View deals 12401 International Drive +1 239 671 8091 Monday 08:00 - 17:00 Tuesday 08:00 - 17:00 Wednesday 08:00 - 17:00 Thursday 08:00 - 17:00 Friday 08:00 - 17:00 Saturday 08:00 - 17:00 Sunday 08:00 - 17:00 View deals 139 South Orange Avenue +1 407 362 6086 Monday 08:00 - 17:00 Tuesday 08:00 - 17:00 Wednesday 08:00 - 17:00 Thursday 08:00 - 17:00 Friday 08:00 - 17:00 View deals 14100 Bonnet Creek Resort Lane +1 239 994 3796 Monday 09:00 - 14:00 Tuesday 09:00 - 14:00 Wednesday 09:00 - 14:00 Thursday 09:00 - 14:00 Friday 09:00 - 14:00 View deals 14900 Chelonia Pkwy Monday 08:00 - 17:00 Tuesday 08:00 - 17:00 Wednesday 08:00 - 17:00 Thursday 08:00 - 17:00 Friday 08:00 - 17:00 Saturday 08:00 - 17:00 Sunday 08:00 - 17:00 View deals 1500 Masters Blvd +1 407 750 2053 Monday 13:00 - 17:0008:00 - 17:00 Tuesday 13:00 - 17:0008:00 - 17:00 Wednesday 13:00 - 17:0008:00 - 17:00 Thursday 08:00 - 17:0013:00 - 17:00 Friday 08:00 - 17:0013:00 - 17:00 Saturday 08:00 - 17:0013:00 - 17:00 Sunday 08:00 - 17:0013:00 - 17:00 View deals 3535 West Colonial Drive +1 407 822 8110 Monday 08:00 - 17:00 Tuesday 08:00 - 17:00 Wednesday 08:00 - 17:00 Thursday 08:00 - 17:00 Friday 08:00 - 17:00 Saturday 09:00 - 14:00 View deals 3575 Vineland Road +1 407 849 3002 Monday 08:00 - 17:00 Tuesday 08:00 - 17:00 Wednesday 08:00 - 17:00 Thursday 08:00 - 17:00 Friday 08:00 - 17:00 View deals 4012 Central Florida Pkwy +1 239 671 8091 Monday 09:00 - 14:00 Thursday 08:00 - 17:00 Friday 08:00 - 17:00 Saturday 08:00 - 17:00 Sunday 08:00 - 17:00 View deals 4040 Central Florida Pwky +1 407 861 2339 Monday 10:00 - 14:00 Tuesday 10:00 - 14:00 Wednesday 10:00 - 14:00 Thursday 10:00 - 14:00 Friday 10:00 - 14:00 View deals 4134 Bear Road +1 407 859 1245 Monday 07:00 - 19:00 Tuesday 07:00 - 19:00 Wednesday 07:00 - 19:00 Thursday 07:00 - 19:00 Friday 07:00 - 19:00 Saturday 07:00 - 19:00 Sunday 07:00 - 19:00 View deals 4215 Lindy Cirlce +1 407 859 8400 Monday 00:00 - 23:59 Tuesday 00:00 - 23:59 Wednesday 00:00 - 23:59 Thursday 00:00 - 23:59 Friday 00:00 - 23:59 Saturday 00:00 - 23:59 Sunday 00:00 - 23:59 View deals 5387 Butler National Drive +1 407 816 8846 Monday 10:00 - 14:00 Tuesday 10:00 - 14:00 Wednesday 10:00 - 14:00 Thursday 10:00 - 14:00 Friday 10:00 - 14:00 Saturday 10:00 - 14:00 View deals 5398 Lee Vista Blvd +1 800 654 3131 Monday 09:00 - 14:00 Tuesday 09:00 - 14:00 Wednesday 09:00 - 14:00 Thursday 09:00 - 14:00 Friday 09:00 - 14:00 View deals 6001 Destination Parkway +1 321 332 2836 Monday 09:00 - 14:00 Tuesday 09:00 - 14:00 Wednesday 09:00 - 14:00 Thursday 09:00 - 14:00 Friday 09:00 - 14:00 Saturday 09:00 - 14:00 View deals 6300, Hollywood Way Opening times not available View deals 6550 Adventure Way +1 407 503 3156 Monday 08:00 - 17:0014:00 - 17:00 Tuesday 14:00 - 17:0008:00 - 17:00 Wednesday 08:00 - 17:0014:00 - 17:00 Thursday 08:00 - 17:0014:00 - 17:00 Friday 14:00 - 17:0008:00 - 17:00 Saturday 14:00 - 17:0008:00 - 17:00 Sunday 14:00 - 17:0008:00 - 17:00 View deals 6677 Sea Harbor Dr +1 407 494 7355 Monday 08:00 - 17:0013:30 - 17:00 Tuesday 08:00 - 17:0013:30 - 17:00 Wednesday 13:30 - 17:0008:00 - 17:00 Thursday 08:00 - 17:0013:30 - 17:00 Friday 13:30 - 17:0008:00 - 17:00 Saturday 13:30 - 17:0008:00 - 17:00 Sunday 13:30 - 17:0008:00 - 17:00 View deals 7400 International Drive +1 239 671 7221 Tuesday 09:00 - 14:00 Wednesday 09:00 - 14:00 Thursday 09:00 - 14:00 Friday 09:00 - 14:00 Saturday 09:00 - 14:00 View deals 7499 S Augusta National Dr. +1 407 251 4640 Monday 08:00 - 17:00 Tuesday 08:00 - 17:00 Wednesday 08:00 - 17:00 Thursday 08:00 - 17:00 Friday 08:00 - 17:00 View deals 8701 World Cntr Dr +1 321 697 6100 Monday 09:00 - 14:00 Tuesday 09:00 - 14:00 Wednesday 09:00 - 14:00 Thursday 09:00 - 14:00 Friday 09:00 - 14:00 View deals 9001 E.

The location is outside and far from the airport. We took a Wally Park shuttle to get there. There were two agents at the counter in the Advantage office. Each talking to a customer trying to sell them odd items. it took 45 minutes for us in the line and they didn’t even acknowledge our presence. When I asked them how much more I should wait they said as much as it takes! When we got to the counter, the agent told us that we have to agree to give $750 deposit and give them our utility bill to prove that we are the resident of the state!! I’ve never seen a rental car company, asking for utility bill and $750 deposit. Then he started asking questions about my ethnicity and race. I reminded him that these are unacceptable racist questions and then he started raising his voice and saying he doesn’t want to give me any service and I have to leave and he’s going to call the police if I don’t leave the facility and I welcome the idea and I said yes, let’s call the police so we can explain to them how you’re treating a woman and then he said no I don’t want to call the police, and yelled get out of this building, So disrespectful, and insulting, Pure abusive, just because of my race and the fact that I was a woman! I’ve never had such a terrible experience if KAYAK introduces companies like that, I will stop using KAYAK after 18 years, not only me, but my entire family will not use KAYAK ever again. I felt threatened, and very unsafe. I felt abused and I Left the building to get a car to go back to CMO airport and rent another car from another rental company which treated me with respect and didn’t ask for $750 deposit or utility bill. Shame on advantage and shame on KAYAK that made me have such a terrible experience! 10.0 Wonderful Nov. 2023Honestly, most rental car places are pretty similar. Customer service and the efficiency with which one can pick up a car and then drop it off makes the major difference. At Advantage MCO, the service was superlative. The CSR named Dora has repeatedly helped me through the process in an efficient and friendly manner - she is a gem. I own and have owned several companies. I would hire her in a second, if I could do so. 2.0 Poor Nov. 2023Never got to the car because the shuttle took forever to come around. Went with another company. 2.0 Poor Oct. 2023At pick up moment, charged me extra services and the real cost was very expensive 6.0 Okay Oct. 2023The lines at th4 facility erred unnecessarily long. With people in lime (and not that many), agents abandoned countless while others watched by and simply socialize 10.0 Wonderful Oct. 2023Advantage is the best place to rent a car in the Orlando airport area. They are slightly off property so we have to take a shuttle bus. Usually it’s pretty quick, but sometimes it can take 15 to 20 minutes to catch the shuttle bus. That said, once you get your car, which is usually pretty quick experience,, you’ll have very, very easy access to major roadways getting out of the area. This is a really big benefit compared to trying to serpentine your way out of MCO. The price was also excellent. Customer service was very good.

This wouldn't have been an issue if not for the rental shuttle service. The driver was notably rude and seemed to have a limited understanding of English, which made communication frustratingly difficult. This was the first red flag that hinted at the service quality I was about to receive.The process at the rental office didn't improve things. Despite explaining that my basic insurance was already covered through my credit card, I was coerced into taking additional insurance Speaking of the booking, the total cost of the rental was another major point of contention. The amount I ended up paying was more than double the price I had initially signed up for on their website. This lack of transparency in pricing was not only misleading but also put a significant dent in my travel budget.Had I been made aware of these issues – the poor shuttle service, the aggressive upselling of insurance, and the misleading pricing – I could have made a more informed decision and likely chosen a different company for my car rental needs.In summary, my experience with Ace car rental orlando airport was far from pleasant, highlighted by poor customer service and a lack of transparency. I hope this feedback helps others in making a more informed choice. 10.0 Wonderful Nov. 2023Only issue was getting to the place from the airport. There was supposed to be regular shuttles but they were really slow. We ended up taking a taxi ($20). Otherwise everything was smooth.

The auto insurance card won't do: you have to have THE FULL POLICY document with you. 3) If your own insurance has a large deductible, then you HAVE to buy the agency's expensive insurance. The upper limit is $500. Otherwise, they take out $500 from your credit card which they say they'll pay back after 30 days--just long enough to incur a charge of INTEREST on the payment.l 4) If you don't pay the agency in advance for tolls, you can't pay cash at the toll booth. The rental agency toll device will trigger if you drive a toll road, and you'll pay $14 regardless of whether you paid in cash. All of this is "negotiated" when you go pick up your car, and the negotiations can take more than AN HOUR, so wait time and long lines are ridiculously, maddeningly long.

When the shuttle dropped me at the Nextcar address, i walked in to the open counter and was told that my reservation had been cancelled because I was more than 1 hour beyond my reservation start time.

When I landed at the airport to pick up my rental car, the woman at the counter informed me it was not paid for just "reserved" and they couldn't charge the same card. A rental car for an entire week is A LOT of money to pay when you are under the assumption it is already paid for. This was definitely not communicated clearly in the booking process. I have rented cars several other times at a variety of places and this was not the process previously. When I returned the car to the airport, not a single counter was manned. All counters had signs pointing to each other saying "if no one is at this counter please go to the (insert company name here) counter".....but nobody was there.

In addition, the $250.00 "security deposit" has not been refunded or credited to my credit card as of yet. I have tried all morning to reach the agency to inquire about this. They answered only after about 30 minutes of putting me on hold. The representative could not give me any reasonable answers about the additional charges, but said the security deposit would take 5-10 business days. I will monitor that. Please remove Global Car Rental from your list of agencies. They have committed what I believe is a classic case of Bait and Switch. 10.0 Wonderful Sep. 2023Servicio rapido. Ningun cargo sorpresa.

I didn’t like the fact that there’s no credit for early return. The car had a terrible smell from the deodorant that they put in it that literally made us sick for about three weeks had to leave the windows down as often as possible I would never rent from them again. 4.0 Mediocre Sep. 2023Orlando: explanation of car controls was marginal. Address and phone provided on initial information provided by KAYAK was inaccurate. I attempted to return car at address provided and the address was incorrect. Had go search for Global address and it was about 20 mile drive. Ultimately recognized location. Good thing I had plenty of time before flight. Fee for rental was half what actual rental was. No choice but to go ahead with the rental since Global was off site with no alternative rental agencies close. Boston: rental reservation with Thrifty was canceled before rental date. Thrifty was not considering "walk in" rentals of gas vehicles. Was offered an EV which I took. Would be reluctant to use KAYAK again. 8.0 Very good Aug. 2023Very Good customer service.

Cons:It took awhile to get through when we called from the airport When we were filling out the paperwork they charged an additional $121 because they said we had to pay for an additional driver. We said no we only wanted my husband to drive. They said because I was the one filling out the application we had to pay for 2 drivers. Will never use this place again! 5.2 Fair Sep. 2017 Pros:The staff were well dressed and the facility was clean. The air conditioning was cold and the water was free. That's where the accolades stop. Cons:My $77 weekend car rental turned into $212 because they claimed that I picked the car up later than I said I would and then dropped it off later than I said I would, neither of which were true. They also would not let me leave with the car unless I agreed to pay $15 per day for liability insurance even though I had proof of full coverage from my AMEX. DO NOT RENT YOUR CAR FROM THESE PEOPLE. Not if you value your money. 2.0 Poor Aug. 2017 Pros:Nothing Cons:Wrong address was provided and information was not clear on rental pick up. Did not pick up rental at all. Not pleased and they are refusing a refund. Won't be using kayak or priceless ever again! 4.0 Mediocre Sep. 2016 Pros:Nothing Cons:Rented the car online using KAYAK. The total cost for the vehicle was 55 dollars. When I pick up the car, I always decline the insurance and gas option. When I did, they required me to show proof of insurance. I did not have any proof of insurance from my company and I do not care my personal insurance card with me. So I could not get the car unless I purchased their insurance. The car was horrible. It had a bad vibration, it made a horrible noise, the air did not work one time until I figured out the key had to be in the exact right spot for the blower/air to work. It had a hose hanging down below the vehicle. At the end of the week, my 55 dollar rental ended up costing 180 dollars. I always use KAYAK for my rentals....I wish they would pull Priceless Car Rentals off of their site. I will never use Priceless again. 8.0 Very good Aug. 2016 Cons:Took about 30 min to check in at the counter. It was only one person in front of me. Both the customer and the clerk in the front counter were very slow at rent a car processing. The other clerk got on the phone pretending not seeing other standing clients. Office environment very boring and basic not even a tiny green plant or poster hanging. Aunts are marching on bathroom floor. beware of insurance policy add up at the counter before even they ask you what kind of policy you like to carry... they did upgrade me to another car because of my long waiting. However these people at the rent a car they don't get it! Efficiency and fast processing matters when the time is of essence. We are not there to test drive a intermediate car we need a quick ride and process to catch up with the business meeting etc,...

Happy to have Uber and Lift so my vacation wasn’t ruined 2.0 Poor Oct. 2023Hidden Fees, do not get comfortable with the initial price you paid online, it goes up by a lot once you check in. Also, give yourself plenty of time as the shuttle will take over an hour eventhough they say 15-20 mins. 2.0 Poor Oct. 2023Its seem like scam. I end up paying 150.00 plus the 25.00 6.0 Okay Sep. 2023The wait when you get there is atrocious. We’re talking an hour or more. You better have the correct kind of auto insurance, or they will get you while you’re there. Make sure to have full coverage auto insurance and your declaration of insurance, too. It seemed like this company would find a way to make sure you were charged more than just the rental of the car. Toll fees. You pay to deny their package, or you pay for their package.8 And the security deposit is all over the place. Everyone there was being charged $250, but I was charged $1000. I asked why and was told it was double your deductible. I met a gentleman there who had a $500 deductible and he was only charged $250 for the security deposit. Just seemed like a lot of “under the table” fees that you get popped with when you’re there and because you book through a 3rd party, you can’t get your money back. 2.0 Poor Sep. 2023Don’t ever rent from this place! Biggest scam artist ever… booked a rental for $75 and was told they “gave my rental car away already” and all they had available was an upgraded mid size sedan but had to pay $400… mean while there was a ton of compact sedans in their parking lot. Staff was rude and car was dirty before pickup. Much better options in the Orlando area. Would never ever recommend this rental company to anyone 2.0 Poor Jul. 2022This company is a total rip off. Your site quotes a price and you must prepay in full. They claim you paid a lesser amount and the add a ton of so called must have to use their vehicles. So you pay more in the end and should went the bigger rental companies who are above board. These guys are nothing but scammers. Every person that went to pick up a vehicle was screaming at them saying what is the actual total i am being charged and some were literally losing their mind when they were given the amount.

My phone was on airplane mode. and was not able to get their texts. They cancelled the car. We had to scramble to get another rental. 2.0 Poor Jul. 2023Staff was very friendly !! Car was clean and very reliable. Although I was not expecting an extra $230 in fees that I had to pay when I got there. I paid $52 for the 3 days I was going to be there when I made the reservation, but when I got there I had to pay an extra $230. They advertised it to be $7/day + tax which was a great deal so I jumped on it. Because of that I won’t rent from them again. I’ll stick with the rentals at the airport. 2.0 Poor Jun. 2023Disappointed enough to not request more of your services because I closed the business and when I arrived at the agency they demanded a new insurance and asked me for an extra $650. Everything must be dealt with before, both the price, requirements and documentation and when the client pays, the business is closed, and it is criminal that we cleinyes are surprised when we arrive for what we buy or lease. President Baiden said that these bad practices must end so that there is confidence and business is generated in the country. You are ruining the system. Now I want my money back in full since I had to rent a car elsewhere. 2.0 Poor Jun. 2023I liked that they stayed open late to help, us get our car. I did not like that even though I have USAA Insurance and showed them my insurance card they would not accept it and had to call my home to have them send in the declaration sheet. and once they received it they claimed that I did not have enough Property Damage coverage I have $100,000 coverage but they require $300,000 coverage. I could not contact USAA since it was late . Your staff told me that Kayak had sent me a notice that I would need the $300,000 coverage in order to rent their car , but I did not receive such notification. I was advised that in order to rent the car I would have to pay $194.00 to get the $300,000 coverage. I called USAA on 6/12/203 and they advised me that what I was advised to pay was not right , but their was nothing I can do but I did advise them of the insurance you were asking me for and hopefully this would not happen to any other USAA Member . I had to pay an additional $194.00 for Property Damage Coverage. This was not a pleasant experience.

My family rented two cars from Wheego from the Kayak app from Nov 9-18th. When we went for to get our shuttle we waited 45 mins and told to get on a shuttle named Nexcar. We thought they shared shuttles. We were taken to the Nexcar Rental building. Quite a dive. They had our reservations there. Our Canadian Insurance was refused(they said they refuse all Canadian and a lot of American Ins). We had shown them proof of our insurance that said we were covered for rentals. They were cold and uncaring and said if we didn't buy their insurance we couldn't have the cars and would not get our money back. We had to pay 373 USD each for the insurance. We had been travelling all day and had small children. We felt we didn't have any other option than to preceeded with the rental. Our insurance companies said(we called) said as far as they were concerned, we were covered and didn't need any extra insurance. Why were we sent to Nexcar? We expected to rent from Wheego. We want to be refunded our insurance paid. We can provide any documentation needed. We search reviews and if we had known this was where we were being sent we would have searched reviews(they are all terrible) and the Nexcar policy, cancelled our rentals and booked elsewhere. We have rented off site in the past and this has never happened to us. I have never been concerned with using Kayak but now am very hesitant. I would like to speak to someone about this. We need some answers of why this went so wrong. My number is 506-440-3387. Kathy Barnet. 2.0 Poor Nov. 2023Our credit card insurance (visa infinite) was not accepted and they tried to make us pay $50/day for their insurance. We would not pay it.

While the state of Florida only requires a driver’s license from your native country to drive in Florida, international drivers might want to check their car rental company’s policy regarding international drivers just in case. Most car rental companies require drivers to be at least 21, while many have a minimum age requirement of 25 years old. A credit card in the driver’s name is typically required for security purposes and many do not accept cash or debit card deposits. You will also need proof of insurance or to buy insurance through the rental company to ensure you have financial responsibility for any potential damages that may happen during the rental period. Lastly, it is common for rental companies to run a brief driving history check to ensure the renter has a clean driving record. Types of cars available to rent in Orlando How to get the best price Price fare wars are common between car rental companies at Orlando International Airport. To secure the best rental car deals, book several weeks in advance and check for updated prices regularly, particularly five weeks before your arrival. Do not pre-pay for your rental car. Instead, opt for a flexible booking option as this allows you to rebook at a lower rate should prices drop. Orlando is a popular tourist destination that offers a variety of car rental options to suit the needs of every traveler. Major rental companies – like Enterprise, Hertz, and Avis – offer everything from compact and economical models, ideal for city travel, to full-size sedans and SUVs that provide extra space for families or groups. More adventurous travelers might consider a 4×4 or a convertible to enjoy Florida’s sun. For environmentally conscious travelers, some rental companies even provide hybrid or electric vehicles. Remember, booking ahead – especially during peak tourist season – ensures you get the vehicle that best suits your needs and budget. Where to rent a car at the Orlando Airport Because Orlando is such a popular tourist destination, lines at the airport’s rental car check-in area can be excruciatingly long. If you are renting a car at the airport, I would suggest opting for the Skip the Counter service. Most car rental companies let you fill out the check-in registration online before you travel. That way you can completely skip the line at the rental counter when you arrive and go straight to the car garage to pick up your car. The primary spot to rent a car is at the Orlando International Airport where you’ll find numerous rental companies, like Enterprise, Hertz, Avis, and Budget, in the Ground Transportation area. This is a convenient option if you’re flying into the city. Alternatively, major car rental agencies have locations throughout the city in popular tourist areas, like Downtown Orlando, International Dive, Kissimmee, and near Walt Disney World. Certain area hotels even offer car rental services on-site for guests. What to know about toll roads in Orlando Orlando has an extensive network of ten toll roads that connect various destinations throughout the city and beyond. Unless you want to add significant time to your travels, you will likely use at least one of the toll roads during your trip. For example, the typical drive from the airport to Disney World’s Epcot is 25 minutes using tolls and 50 minutes without using them, while the typical drive from Disney Springs to Cocoa Beach is 70 minutes using toll roads and 110 minutes without them. Companies frequently charge up to $4.95 per day for transponder rentals, which means that during a ten-day vacation you could spend $50 for just the ability to pay the tolls. In addition to this, toll roads typically charge people paying with a transponder the cash rate – the highest possible toll rate – for each toll. If you know you will be doing a lot of driving, consider getting a Visitor Toll Pass. The Visitor Toll Pass is a simple solution for anyone renting a vehicle at Orlando International Airport, enabling you to pay road tolls electronically. The free transponder tag that you can hang from your rental car’s front mirror allows you to bypass the rental car toll devices and pay tolls on your own. You can get the Visitor Toll Pass by downloading the app or visiting the toll pass vending kiosk at the airport. Once you have the pass, be sure to decline the rental car toll transponder option on your rental contract. Parking your rental car in Orlando Parking in Downtown Orlando is straightforward. Some street parking is free, while metered spots generally cost $2 per hour. Parking garages usually impose a flat rate of approximately $10-$15 per day. Parking fees at most theme parks can range from $25 to $50 per day; however, many of them provide complimentary shuttle buses to transport visitors to and from their hotels. Self-parking is free at some resorts and hotels, while others charge for the service. It’s worth noting that parking in residential neighborhoods may require a permit, so be sure to check local signage. Using a parking app can be a convenient way to find and pay for parking in Orlando. Seasonal driving tips for Orlando During Central Florida’s wet season (June through October), it is not uncommon to experience afternoon rain showers almost every day. When driving in Orlando during rainfall, maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front as roads can get slippery, so be sure to reduce your vehicle’s grip and increase stopping distances. Avoid sudden braking and use your headlights to increase visibility. If the rain is extremely heavy, it may be safer to pull over and wait until the downpour eases.
