I have seen in some other airlines that one is provided with a sticker to place on your seat to show if you can or cannot be woken up" Cons: "The baggage restriction was not good at least one Checking should be allowed" Pros: "I did not make it on the flight as the time was given was 5:35 and the flight left at 4:00." Cons: "I was not given correct information and being a very novice traveller did not check the information." Cons: "From Vancouver to Los Angeles no screen seats no Entertainment" Pros: "Seats had room. Entertainment options were quite good." Cons: "WestJet has lost its Chutzpah. No longer knows it’s identity. Food choices were terrible for a 5.5 hour flight, and the couple of okay choices they were out of very quickly. Crew was friendly enough but no sparkle." Pros: "Smooth trip." Cons: "No one would get a wheelchair to get to cart that was on different floor. Driver didn't volunteer to carry bags to cart." Pros: "Everything about the flight was fine except the delay waiting for the new crew." Cons: "The 90 minute delay taking off. The difficulty getting WestJet Connect entertainment software to work with my laptop. I finally gave up & watched tv on my phone." Pros: "Crew did a good job, even with the long delays." Cons: "Plane was almost 2 hours late getting to LA. Started with the crew needing to clear customs in Vancouver. Delayed by 30 minutes....then the crew preboarded a sick lady and her travel companion. At some point crew decided she should not fly to LA, but the ladies wouldn’t get off plane! 45 minutes later and 4 RCMP show up to escort them off plane. Then we didn’t have any ground crew to get us off loading ramp. Finally got away 90 minutes or more after scheduled departure. Circled LA a few times before getting to land.... long flight with long delays!" Pros: "Had a fantastic experience on my first round trip with WestJet. Very satisfied, would definitely fly them again. I also liked how we were able to clear Customers BEFORE we departed from YVR; made the arrival that much smoother when we landed at SFO" Pros: "Uncomfortable, babies crying. Flight attendants disappeared after first drinks. No offers of head phones, snacks etc Delta Flight from Tampa to Minneapolis was excellent" Cons: "Mentioned above" Can't be happy with a 5 hour delay. Only given $10 voucher for food and still EVERYTHING was an upcharge during the flight. TThe first time I have ever flown with flare and both ways sucked There was no entertainment There was no food or beverage service , not even a glass of water The plane door could not be opened upon arrival I try to buy water the cabin crews told me I had to wait for them to come around with the trolley I waited over 2 hours !!!!! Literally 2 hours I was so thirsty . Lots of leg room in the front rows. Wish water was free. I don't like anything. The crew was so bad. Misbehaved badly. The worst flight. Long wait for baggage check in with only one on site attendant. The worst airlines I have seen in my life they don’t respect anyone they don’t care about anyone they lost our luggage and no one is responding. We waited for five hours to get our luggage back.🤬🤬🤬👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 Great staff. Cramped seating for someone 5 feet, 2 inches and average weight. So if you're tall or heavy -- good luck. Even if you wait until the 24 hour checkin time, you still charge for seating. Really? So either it is a less-than-pleasant experience or pay the price of a "big name" airline. And if I'm going to pay their prices, why would I fly in your cramped seat? So, in the end, you want to give less comfort for the same prices as Air Canada. Go figure.
