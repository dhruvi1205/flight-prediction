Cons: "The food could have been better. I don’t mind paying but some nicer, healthier choices would have been nice. It is airplane food so no real surprise. :)" Cons: "Wake people up when serving anything.. I have seen in some other airlines that one is provided with a sticker to place on your seat to show if you can or cannot be woken up" Pros: "No one disturbed me while sleeping and crew was helpful when I woke as bad needed refreshments." Cons: "More leg room" Cons: "The baggage restriction was not good at least one Checking should be allowed" Pros: "Crew was great." Cons: "Communication as to why we were promoted to premier seats and service." Pros: "The check-in process was very easy and friendly. The flight attendants seemed nicer than other airlines." Cons: "Minor point. They boarded the plane very early. We got to the gate 1/2 hour before departure, and were almost the last ones to board." Pros: "Dry accommodating staff all around. Thank you" Cons: "More space between people. Not much you can do I understand that. So overall great" Pros: "Seat was uncomfortable because of the head rest that is attached to the seat. However the staff and crew were friendly and helpful." Cons: "Better seats" I had checked in online the day before but was instructed to collect our boarding passes when we arrived. I am not completely comfortable using the automated Kiosks and always enjoy the nostalgia of speaking with someone when checking in for a flight. Upon doing so however, we were immediately asked,"did you check in online already?" To which I replied, "yes, but we were asked to retrieve our boarding passes upon arrival." She then said, "that's what those machines over there are for. We really encourage people to use those." That unfortunately sparked a series of shortness and overall poor behavior in my opinion from the woman who checked us in. I understand it was early in the morning but I am always excited to experience flying and that interaction has unfortunately left a bitter taste in my mouth to the point I will forever now hesitate to book with Porter again. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Cheers, JD Everything was fantastic, by far the best airline experience in Canada 🇨🇦! Unlike our porter connection this was great , smooth 2minutes at check in not 90 mins Food wasn’t great but it’s plane food , staff were great Porter, like most airlines, need to improve their baggage policies. In reality, there are no longer 'cheap flights' because passengers pay exorbitant baggage fees. Pros: "Great value. Free beverages including a small selection of beer, wine and whiskey. Otherwise no frills, no with, no entertainment. Short haul flights, no problem. Best bargain airline" Cons: "There is a fee to change your assigned seat US$10-20(?), regardless of whether it's a "better" seat. Fortunately, this trip our seats (family of three) were near where we wanted to be. But, it would have been disappointing to have to pay for each seat change for each leg, each way." Cons: "I was ripped of by baggage check!! They sold my a basic fare, which is 20 less than standard, but never told me I had to check my back which cost 40! Ended up costing me more!! I was furious" Cons: "Needs to be more clear that you have to pay to bring bag on." Pros: "I got to the destination." Cons: "I could not have been ripped off with extra baggage fees." Pros: "Convenient! Love flying to Toronto on Porter. Nice glassware for drinks. Unique feel. Will definitely fly again!" Cons: "The flight was delayed by 2 hours . We missed our appointment and want to be compensated!!!" Rude flight attendant. No complimentary snacks available. Refused a refill of juice. Restrooms dirty. Not having a nearly two hour delay on my return flight to Winnipeg would have been better Being in business class made every aspect of the flight more comfortable and convenient; boarding was faster, the space was cozier, having a pleasant inflight meal (in this case, a parsley omelette), and above all, having two checked luggages included in the upgrade from economy? It was possibly the best flight I've ever been on. We were frustrated about the way they treated us as Star Alliance Gold. No early boarding and we had to argue for priority luggage. Unfriendly staff, delayed flight, luggage took almost an hour. Very disappointing. One United employee a little impatient, also on flight WiFi was out for some time. I was happy to receive a complimentary alcoholic beverage for volunteering to check my carry on bag. I enjoyed everything generally. However, getting from the Tarmac to the arrival building required we got on a Bus and meaning they had to wait on everyone to get in from the plane eating a significant amount of time and we still had to get o. The air shuttle to get to the arrival building and saw passengers with connections having to run all the way. The flight was nice overall! No real other comments, everything was fairly reasonable from the airport process to departure and arrival. There was a bit of delay in the departure, but was well communicated and did not severely affect the arrival time beyond 20-30 minutes. My experience flying from Ottawa to Montreal was not good! Departed 20 min late because it was waiting for other connecting passengers which is appreciated. Plane was clean and crew was welcoming. Will repeat. Flight delayed by 4 hours but no communication. With passengers until after the posted departure time became apparent the flight was not going to board even close to on time. Flight was sent canceled. The absolute most useless staff I have ever witnessed. Utterly careless - literally could not care less. 100% never using this airline again. Poor communication at the check in counter and boarding gates. Other then the screaming baby the flight was fine, nothing special Check in experience was smooth, and the flight attendants were courteous and friendly. Very positive experience overall, thank you all! Flight arrived late but other than that everything else okay Great price for a new plane. Only offered water which we knew. Can't be happy with a 5 hour delay. Only given $10 voucher for food and still EVERYTHING was an upcharge during the flight. TThe first time I have ever flown with flare and both ways sucked There was no entertainment There was no food or beverage service , not even a glass of water The plane door could not be opened upon arrival I try to buy water the cabin crews told me I had to wait for them to come around with the trolley I waited over 2 hours !!!!! Literally 2 hours I was so thirsty . Lots of leg room in the front rows. Wish water was free. I don't like anything. The crew was so bad. Misbehaved badly. The worst flight. Long wait for baggage check in with only one on site attendant. The worst airlines I have seen in my life they don’t respect anyone they don’t care about anyone they lost our luggage and no one is responding. We waited for five hours to get our luggage back.🤬🤬🤬👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 Great staff. Cramped seating for someone 5 feet, 2 inches and average weight. So if you're tall or heavy -- good luck. Even if you wait until the 24 hour checkin time, you still charge for seating. Really? So either it is a less-than-pleasant experience or pay the price of a "big name" airline. And if I'm going to pay their prices, why would I fly in your cramped seat? So, in the end, you want to give less comfort for the same prices as Air Canada. Go figure.
