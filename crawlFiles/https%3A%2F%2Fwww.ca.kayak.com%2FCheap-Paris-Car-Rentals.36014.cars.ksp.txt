KAYAK’s top tips for renting a car in Paris The capital of France is an excellent place to explore with a rental car. The city is compact and easy to navigate, while its surrounding towns and villages make for a great day trip from Paris. In addition, traffic in the city isn't as bad as you think. If you want to rent a car in Paris, here are some important tips that will help make your experience as stress-free as possible. One way to make your driving experience in Paris more manageable is by bringing an extra map. You can find GPS maps for virtually any country online and in most outdoor stores, making it easy to pick up a map for Paris. This can be especially helpful if you are new to driving in the city, as a GPS map can show you where the various landmarks are located. When you arrive in Paris, you should also reserve your car ahead of time. This will make it easier to find a location that has availability and will help you avoid any issues with the rental location. You can reserve your car ahead of time by using services like Getaround or its dedicated app for France. With either option, you can search for locations in Paris that have available cars easily. Planning on picking up a rental car upon landing in Paris? For flights landing at Charles de Gaulle Airport, you will be able to find rental car desks in Terminals 1, 2ACD, 2E, 2F, and 2G. If your flight lands at Orly Airport instead, then the rental car agencies will be found in Terminal Ouest. Paris can be very difficult to navigate for drivers unfamiliar with the city; the large roundabouts and narrow one-way lanes are especially challenging. It is highly advised to stick to the outlying areas of the city if you are driving, as the main downtown areas can be quite congested and there is limited parking. However, one possible compromise is to park in an outer area and take public transportation into the central arrondissements (districts). As work typically starts around 9 a.m. in Paris, morning rush hour lasts a bit later there in comparison to cities in North America. In general, morning rush hour lasts from 7:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and it is particularly bad for drivers heading into the city. Evening rush hour lasts from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. with outbound traffic leaving Paris experiencing the worst of it. Looking forward to visiting the Versailles Palace during your time in France? One great way to get there is to rent a car while you are vacationing in Paris. Versailles, Disneyland, and Fontainebleau are just some of the day trips that are easily reached via rental car from Paris. 25% of our users found rental cars in Paris for C$ 43 or less Book your rental car in Paris at least 2 days before your trip in order to get a below-average price Off-airport rental car locations in Paris are around 1% cheaper than airport locations on average Mini rental cars in Paris are around 32% cheaper than other car types, on average Paris car rental experiences: the best tips from KAYAK users Insights shared by verified travelers who rented a car in Paris Learn how KAYAK collects reviews and tips from users. LaurelSep. 2023 It was fun to drive through France. As an American, this trip reiterated to me that most of the time it’s better to take a train. It’s usually faster and less expensive (unlike in the U.S.). The tolls I paid were probably close to €100 each way and parking is often quite expensive. Also, lookout for the signs that indicate a camera speed trap, they are common. I would stick to the speed limit! Next time I want a road trip, I’ll plan more time and instead of paying tolls, I’ll avoid the toll ways and try taking the country roads for a longer but more pleasant ride. Use the toll money to pay for a hotel in a countryside place instead! However, I appreciate that there is inventive to take the more environmentally friendly option. Verified travelerOct. 2023 No need to show up early; your car won't be ready. It would also be nice to know that you can drop your car at any location when returning. This was a huge help as we took the car on the east end of downtown Paris, and returned it at the airport. MarkSep. 2023 Be carful following Apple Maps in Paris - our routed us through the pedestrian area of the Louvre. Other than that, Paris is no more difficult than driving in Chicago or New York. Verified travelerSep. 2023 I left immediately from Paris. Verified travelerJun. 2023 When you buy gas, the gas stations bill your credit card for the gas and another charge as a hold of some sort. At first, I thought we were being defrauded, it the charges came off once the payment was made by the credit card company. Paris is a tough place to drive and gas is expensive. Driving in the ritual areas of France is great and the scenery is spectacular. Verified travelerJul. 2023 Rent from a company that actually cares about their customers and does not our source support to a third party. AlbertAug. 2023 driving in paris and around france was great. In general, there are better drivers in frnace then in the USA Verified travelerAug. 2023 Use Sixt as the service is very personable,friendly and courteous! Verified travelerAug. 2023 Small cars for city driving is fine. A larger car with a slightly bigger engine is more comfortable for high way driving Verified travelerAug. 2023 For returning of the car Alamo has point of collection in both terminals 1 and 2 in CDG AirPort SteveJun. 2023 Drove from CDG directly to the west coast without passing through Paris. Verified travelerMay 2023 I drove on the outside of Paris and was good experience. Verified travelerMay 2023 There is a tremendous amount of construction and rerouting in parts of the city that GPS system does not anticipate. It would be good to be prepared for this. It added to our driving time. Also, it would be helpful to know where there are gas stations that stay open late near the car drop off Verified travelerMay 2023 Embrace the chaos. Drive defensively and very alert since traffic rules appear largely optional and there are a lot of scooters/motorcycles zipping through congested traffic. Avoid rush hours if at all possible. Expect delays. FAQs about renting a car in Paris What type of car is recommended for driving in Paris?

After duly returning the car with 7/8 + tank full, i had to pay 20 euros to 'fill the tank'. The clerk said i could avoid that fee by taking the car out of the garage where i had to park it, level -6 at the porte Maillot garage, and find a gas station, a good 45 min round trip operation. So i will take my business elsewhere. 10.0 Wonderful Sep. 2018 Pros:Good Experience. Cons:Nothing.

The pickup at Hertz Charles deGaulle Terminal 3 was terrible. Car wasn't near ready. Long, SLOW processing. I'd never rent from them again - at least not at that site. 10.0 Wonderful Nov. 2022Map and photos to aid car return at DeGaulle Airport in Paris was very helpful. Could have used a similar aid to help guide getting out of the airport when I girst arrived and picked up the car. 10.0 Wonderful Nov. 2022Both gentlemen at the rental counter at Gare du Nord and return counter at Charles de Gaulle were super helpful and friendly. We had missed our pick up the night before due to unforeseen circumstances. Even so, the gentleman the next morning was very accommodating and made sure we still had a great car for our day trip to Brussels. We realized on the way back to Paris that it would be easier/faster to return the car to CDG, even though we had rented under "return to original office" and after several frustrating conversations with the people at Hertz of France customer service we were able to get in touch with the Hertz CDG team and get the information we were looking for. So, in review: The counter staff at both Gare Du Nord, and CDG were very helpful and friendly and went above and beyond to make our experience great. The customer service staff at the main branch of Hertz sucked big time. 10.0 Wonderful Oct. 2022This hertz office was large immaculate and very well run. The ease of renting a car in paris proper rather than at the airport was worth it. Some of the online reviews are so old that they’re just wrong. I will only use this car rental spot for the next year in paris.. They could offer more automatic cars available to rent. Not sure why they only offer stick shift options? Also they should warn foreigners about the hundred of dollars in tolls they will have to pay. And I’m not exaggerating when I say hundreds. It’s obscene what they charge for tolls. It’s laughable. But that isn’t hertz fault however they should be more transparent about it. 2.0 Poor Oct. 2022They charged me for damage when I never hit anything Back 1 out of 21 Next Rent@Car 10.0 Wonderful1 review Cleanliness 8.0 Comfort 8.0 Pick-up/Drop-off 6.0 Value for money 10.0 15 locations in ParisShow locations View deals Rent@Car reviewsCar rental locations Locations in Paris 1 Rue Antonin Mercié +33 1 45 31 89 33 Opening times not available View deals 118 Rue de la Croix Nivert +33 1 48 56 11 11 Opening times not available View deals 15 Rue des Pyramides +33 1 42 96 95 95 Opening times not available View deals 20 Rue du Départ +33 1 43 21 56 50 Opening times not available View deals 25, rue Jean Zay Opening times not available View deals 28 Boulevard Gouvion-Saint-Cyr +33 1 45 74 53 34 Opening times not available View deals 29 Avenue Jean Jaurès +33 1 42 39 05 05 Opening times not available View deals 43, Boulevard Saint Marcel Opening times not available View deals 57, Rue de la procession Opening times not available View deals 58B Boulevard Richard-Lenoir +33 1 43 55 35 05 Opening times not available View deals 62 Boulevard Malesherbes +33 1 45 22 28 28 Opening times not available View deals 78, Boulevard Soult Opening times not available View deals 84, Avenue De Versailles Opening times not available View deals Paris Airport Roissy Charles De Gaulle CDG +33 1 76 36 09 34 Opening times not available View deals Paris Gare de Lyon +33 1 43 45 98 99 Opening times not available View deals Filters Wonderful (1) Very good (0) Good (0) Okay (0) Fair (0) Mediocre (0) Poor (0) Reviews 10.0 Wonderful Jul. 2022Staff was fantastic Back 1 out of 1 Next Thrifty 7.4 Good4 reviews Cleanliness 7.8 Comfort 7.8 Pick-up/Drop-off 6.8 Value for money 7.3 12 locations in ParisShow locations from C$ 49/day View deals Thrifty reviewsCar rental locations Locations in Paris 18 Rue De Dunkerque +33 1 55 31 93 21 Monday 07:00 -

You can even pick up a car in Paris and drop it off at your destination, so no need to backtrack. And if you’re planning an extensive trip throughout France, you may even snag better deals on longer-term rentals. Lane Nieset 20 June 2023 As the capital, all roads really do lead to Paris. But the city’s strategic position in the northern part of France puts you within a quick drive of other scenic stretches of the country, like Normandy, as well as other countries entirely, like Belgium. And for those who enjoy city driving, you can’t get much better than cruising down iconic boulevards like the Champs-Élysées, around squares like Place de la Concorde, and past monuments like the Arc de Triomphe. Car rental companies are located throughout the city, as well as at train stations and in the airports, and most of the rental agencies are open on Sundays and holidays, so you can pick up a car whenever you need it—even if it’s last-minute.

The minimum age to rent a car in Paris is 21, and you will need to have had your license for at least a year. Some companies have a higher age minimum of 25 for certain types of cars, such as luxury vehicles, and most agencies will have a surcharge for “young drivers” under 25 or those over 70. Best cars for navigating Paris Manual or electric car? Manual cars are the most affordable option when it comes to rentals, but electric vehicles can also be a good deal and are especially good in cities since you're not driving long distances. Parking can be a challenge in Paris and some streets or alleys can be a tight squeeze, so unless you’re traveling as a family or group and need car seats or room for luggage, opt for something on the smaller side (there’s a reason why smart cars are so popular). Electric vehicles can be a great way to save on gas, and you’ll find charging stations throughout the city. Where to get a rental car in Paris You can rent a car at both airports (Charles de Gaulle and Paris-Orly) and agencies are open from the first to the last flight. If you’re arriving by train or staying close to a station, you can pick up a car from most of the major train stations, including Gare de Lyon and Gare du Nord. Most of the larger rental agencies have offices scattered throughout the city as well. Taking a rental car outside of Paris If you’re planning to end your trip in another city or country, you can reserve a one-way car rental and drop the car at one of the rental agency’s other locations. Keep in mind this usually ups the fee, especially if you’re returning the car in a different country. Be sure to check to see if your car insurance includes the same level of coverage if you leave the country. Italy, for example, may have its own rules, and some credit card car insurance policies don’t cover rentals in Italy. What to know about car insurance in Paris Drivers need unlimited third-party liability insurance, which agencies may include in their daily rental rates. Often, rental companies include some sort of minimum protection, or you can add on extras like collision protection. If your credit card includes car insurance, you may have to deny the car rental company’s insurance so yours kicks in. As with any city, cars can get bumped or scratched while parked on the street or in a garage, and paint jobs can be pricey, so better to be on the safe side with insurance. What to know about driving in Paris In the city, the average speed limit is 30 km/h (19 mph), but in some spots, it’s 50 km/h (30 mph). The rules change when you get to the ring roads, where the limit is 70 km/h (43 mph). Main roads are usually around 80km/h (50 mph) or 90 km/h (56 mph), while motorways are between 130 km/h (80 mph) and 110 km/h (68 mph), depending on the weather. Always give way to traffic on the right, and cars already in a roundabout have the right of way. While cyclists should be following the same rules of the road, they often weave in and out of traffic, so keep an eye out for bikes and crossing pedestrians. Where to park in Paris Street parking is tough to find, but if you do get lucky and score a spot, you’ll have to pay for parking Monday through Saturday from 9 am to 8 pm and you’re limited to two hours. Depending on where you’re at in the city, the hourly rate is around €6 (about $6.6) in the center of Paris (1st to 11th arrondissements) and about €4 (around $4.4) per hour for the rest of the city. You can pay by credit card or with an app like PaybyPhone. Your best bet is one of the underground garages—marked with signs with a white “P” on a blue background—which are open 24/7 and charge hourly, half-day, and full-day rates, as well as fares for longer stays. If you want to ensure a space before getting to a garage, you can reserve a spot using BePark. Where to fuel up in Paris Your best option for a gas station is around the ring road (périphérique) since there are fewer stations in the more tourist-heavy parts of Paris. Gas averages around €2 (about $2.20) per liter, and some stations are open late (until around 10 p.m.) or 24 hours. To find electric charging stations, use an app like Chargemap or Plug Share, which you can also use to pay for EV chargers.

Seasonal driving advice for Paris Traffic is one of the main problems in Paris, especially in the summer months, so try and avoid rush hour and holiday weekends, when Parisians skip town for the sea or their country home.
